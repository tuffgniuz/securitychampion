*V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture*

# Cryptographic Key Protection

> Ensure that consumers of cryptographic services protect key material and other secrets by using key vaults or API-based alternatives.

## Objective
To integrate secure storage solutions into the architecture and design of applications, ensuring that cryptographic keys and other sensitive materials are protected throughout their lifecycle. This includes secure generation, storage, distribution, and management of keys to prevent unauthorized access and misuse.

## Rationale
Effective cryptographic key management is fundamental to maintaining the security of an applicationâ€™s data. Using secure storage solutions like key vaults or API-based alternatives ensures that keys are managed according to best practices, reducing the risk of exposure and tampering. By embedding these practices into the architecture and design phase, we create a robust security foundation that addresses potential threats early in the development process.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be considered during the architecture and design phases of any system that utilizes cryptographic keys for securing data. It is critical for systems handling sensitive information, such as financial transactions, personal data, or health records. Secure key management should be revisited during threat modeling exercises and regular security reviews to ensure ongoing protection.
