*V2.1 Password Security*

# No Periodic Credential Rotation or Password History

> Verify that there are no periodic credential rotation or password history requirements.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to improve the user experience and security by avoiding unnecessary password changes and maintaining user convenience. Continuous enforcement of periodic password changes can lead to weaker passwords and user frustration.

## Rationale
Mandatory periodic password changes often result in users creating predictable patterns or weaker passwords, as they might resort to slight variations of their old passwords. Eliminating periodic rotation requirements helps users create and maintain strong, unique passwords over time. Moreover, modern security practices emphasize the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and monitoring for compromised credentials over frequent password changes.

## What You Should Do
1. **Avoid Mandatory Password Changes**: Do not enforce policies that require users to change their passwords periodically without a specific reason.
2. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA to enhance security without relying on frequent password changes.
3. **Monitor for Compromised Credentials**: Regularly check passwords against breached password lists and prompt users to change their passwords only if they are compromised.

## Summary
By avoiding periodic credential rotation and password history requirements, you enhance the user experience and encourage the creation of strong, unique passwords. This approach aligns with modern security practices that focus on MFA and compromised credential monitoring, providing a more robust security posture.
