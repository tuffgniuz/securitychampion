# No Periodic Credential Rotation

> Ensure there are no requirements for periodic password changes or maintaining password history.

## Objective
Avoid mandating users to change their passwords at regular intervals and maintaining a history of previous passwords to prevent reuse.

## Rationale
Forcing users to change their passwords regularly can lead to the creation of weaker passwords, as users might resort to slight variations of their old passwords, making them predictable. Additionally, not maintaining a history of previous passwords prevents the risk of storing potentially compromised passwords. Modern security practices emphasize the importance of strong, unique passwords rather than frequent changes.

1. **Predictable Patterns**: When users are required to change passwords frequently, they often create predictable variations, such as "Password1" followed by "Password2," making them easier for attackers to guess.
2. **Password Fatigue**: Frequent password changes can lead to user frustration and poor password management practices, such as writing down passwords or reusing them across different accounts, increasing security risks.

## Key Takeaways
- Do not enforce periodic password changes.
- Focus on ensuring users create strong, unique passwords.
- Avoid maintaining a history of previous passwords to prevent reuse and potential compromise【71:0†source】.
