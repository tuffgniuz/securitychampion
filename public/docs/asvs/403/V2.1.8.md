*V2.1 Password Security*

# Password Strength Meter

> Verify that a password strength meter is provided to help users set a stronger password.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to enhance password security by guiding users to create stronger passwords. A password strength meter provides real-time feedback on the strength of the password being created, encouraging users to choose more secure passwords.

## Rationale
A password strength meter helps users understand the security of their passwords by visually indicating how strong or weak a password is. This proactive measure can significantly improve the overall security of user accounts by:
- **Encouraging Stronger Passwords**: Users are more likely to create complex and secure passwords when they receive immediate feedback on password strength.
- **Reducing Weak Passwords**: Visual cues help reduce the likelihood of users selecting weak or easily guessable passwords.
- **Enhancing User Awareness**: Educates users about what constitutes a strong password and the importance of password complexity.

## What You Should Do
1. **Implement a Password Strength Meter**: Integrate a password strength meter into your application's password creation and update processes.
2. **Provide Real-Time Feedback**: Ensure the password strength meter provides real-time feedback on password complexity and suggests ways to improve weak passwords.
3. **Educate Users**: Use the strength meter as an educational tool to inform users about the components of a strong password.

### Summary
By implementing a password strength meter, you can significantly enhance the security of your application by encouraging users to create stronger, more complex passwords. This proactive measure helps protect user accounts and improves overall security awareness.
