# Password Strength Meter

> Verify that a password strength meter is provided to help users set a stronger password.

## Objective
Encourage users to create strong, secure passwords by providing real-time feedback on the strength of their password choices.

## Rationale
A password strength meter helps users understand the quality of their passwords, guiding them to create stronger and more secure passwords. This visual feedback reduces the likelihood of users setting weak passwords that are easily guessable or vulnerable to attacks.

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Stronger passwords, guided by a strength meter, increase the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks more difficult.
2. **Dictionary Attacks**: By encouraging complex passwords, the strength meter reduces the likelihood of passwords being present in common password dictionaries.
