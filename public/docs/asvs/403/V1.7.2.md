*V1.7 Errors, Logging, and Auditing Architecture*

# Secure Log Transmission

> Verify that logs are securely transmitted to a preferably remote system for analysis, detection, alerting, and escalation.

## Objective
To design and implement a system architecture that ensures logs are securely transmitted to a remote or centralized logging system. This enables reliable analysis, detection of anomalies, alerting for potential security incidents, and appropriate escalation of issues.

## Rationale
Secure transmission of logs is essential to prevent unauthorized access and tampering during transport. By ensuring that logs are sent to a secure, remote system, we protect the integrity and confidentiality of log data, making it available for effective monitoring and incident response. This practice is fundamental in detecting and responding to security events in a timely manner, and helps maintain a comprehensive audit trail for forensic analysis. Integrating secure log transmission into the architecture and design phases ensures that security measures are in place from the beginning, supporting ongoing operational security and compliance.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be implemented during the architecture and design phases of any system that generates logs for security, monitoring, or auditing purposes. It is particularly crucial for systems that handle sensitive data or require high levels of security. Secure log transmission should be reviewed and maintained during regular security audits and updates to ensure its continued effectiveness.
