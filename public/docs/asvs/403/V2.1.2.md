# Password Length Limits

> Verify that passwords of at least 64 characters are permitted, and that passwords of more than 128 characters are denied.

## Objective
Ensure that users can create long, complex passwords for increased security while preventing excessively long passwords that could lead to potential performance issues or vulnerabilities.

## Rationale
Allowing long passwords (up to 64 characters) provides users with the flexibility to create strong, memorable passphrases. However, limiting the maximum length to 128 characters prevents potential issues such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, buffer overflows, or other unexpected behavior that might occur with excessively long input.

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: An attacker might submit extremely long passwords to overload the system's resources, leading to slow performance or even crashing the application. By limiting the maximum password length, you mitigate this risk, ensuring the system remains responsive and stable.
2. **Buffer Overflow Attacks**: Some systems might be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks if they do not handle long input strings properly. An attacker could exploit this by submitting an overly long password, causing the system to execute arbitrary code or crash. Enforcing a maximum password length helps prevent this type of vulnerability.
3. **Unexpected Behavior**: Extremely long passwords can cause unexpected behavior in the application, potentially leading to security flaws or data corruption. By setting a reasonable maximum length, you reduce the risk of such issues, ensuring the application handles passwords predictably and securely.

## Practical Example
When a user sets or updates their password, the application should enforce both a minimum length of 12 characters (as per V2.1.1) and ensure that passwords can be as long as 64 characters but do not exceed 128 characters.

## Code Example (TypeScript)
Here is a TypeScript example that demonstrates how to enforce this requirement:

```typescript
/**
 * Checks if the given password is within the allowed length range.
 * @param password - The password to validate.
 * @returns boolean - True if the password length is between 12 and 128 characters, false otherwise.
 */
function isPasswordValid(password: string): boolean {
    // Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
    const condensedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

    // Check if the password length is within the allowed range
    const length = condensedPassword.length;
    return length >= 12 && length <= 128;
}

// Example usage
const password = "this  is  a  long  password";
if (isPasswordValid(password)) {
    console.log("Password is valid.");
} else {
    console.log("Password must be between 12 and 128 characters long.");
}
```
## Key Takeaways
- Ensure user passwords can be at least 64 characters long.
- Deny passwords longer than 128 characters.
- Combine multiple consecutive spaces into one before checking the length.
- Enforcing this policy helps balance security and performance, allowing users to create strong, memorable passwords without risking potential vulnerabilities due to excessively long inputs.
- This approach mitigates the risks of DoS attacks, buffer overflow attacks, and unexpected behavior due to overly long passwords.
