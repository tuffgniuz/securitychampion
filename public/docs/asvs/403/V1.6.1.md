# Cryptographic Key Management Policy

> Verify that there is an explicit policy for management of cryptographic keys and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard such as NIST SP 800-57.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that cryptographic keys are managed securely throughout their lifecycle, from creation to retirement. This includes having a clear policy that adheres to established standards for key management, ensuring the security and integrity of the cryptographic operations.

## Rationale
Having a robust cryptographic key management policy helps to:
- **Ensure compliance**: Adhere to recognized standards and best practices (e.g., NIST SP 800-57) for key management.
- **Protect keys**: Safeguard cryptographic keys against unauthorized access and misuse.
- **Enhance security**: Ensure that keys are generated, distributed, stored, and retired securely, reducing the risk of key compromise.
- **Facilitate auditing**: Provide a clear framework for auditing and verifying the secure management of cryptographic keys.

### Attack Vectors
- **Key Compromise**: Without a strong management policy, cryptographic keys can be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches.
- **Improper Key Usage**: Lack of clear guidelines can result in keys being used improperly, increasing the risk of cryptographic failures.
- **Key Lifecycle Mismanagement**: Inadequate handling of key lifecycle events (creation, rotation, retirement) can lead to weakened security and increased vulnerability to attacks.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Develop and document a cryptographic key management policy that follows NIST SP 800-57 or similar standards.
- Implement procedures for secure key generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and retirement.
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services (KMS) to enforce and manage cryptographic keys securely.
- Regularly review and update the key management policy to adapt to new security threats and technological advancements.

For example, a financial institution might use an HSM to manage its cryptographic keys. The HSM ensures that keys are generated and stored securely, and it provides mechanisms for key rotation and retirement according to the institution's key management policy.

By implementing a comprehensive cryptographic key management policy, organizations can ensure that their cryptographic operations are secure and resilient against potential attacks.
