*V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture*

# Cryptographic Key Management Policy

> Ensure the existence of a clear policy for managing cryptographic keys, ensuring that the entire key lifecycle adheres to established key management standards, such as NIST SP 800-57.

## Objective
To establish a systematic approach to handling cryptographic keys that ensures their secure generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and destruction. By integrating key management policies into the architecture and design of the application, we ensure that security considerations are incorporated from the beginning and maintained throughout the lifecycle of the system.

## Rationale
Proper management of cryptographic keys is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data. Adhering to recognized key management standards helps prevent unauthorized access and misuse of keys, ensuring that cryptographic systems remain secure throughout their lifecycle. Incorporating these practices into the architecture, design, and threat modeling phases ensures a robust security posture that addresses potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be implemented in any system that uses cryptographic keys to secure data, including web applications, databases, mobile apps, and other systems relying on encryption to protect sensitive information. It is particularly important for systems that handle financial transactions, personal data, health records, and other sensitive data. Ensuring a robust key management policy is critical during the design phase and should be revisited during regular security reviews and audits.
