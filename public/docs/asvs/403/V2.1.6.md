# Password Change Functionality

> Verify that password change functionality requires the user's current password and the new password.

## Objective
Ensure that users can change their password securely by confirming their current password and entering a new password. This helps prevent unauthorized password changes.

## Rationale
Requiring the current password for a password change adds an extra layer of security. It ensures that only the legitimate user, who knows the current password, can change the password. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized users changing the password if they gain access to a logged-in session.

1. **Account Takeover**: Without requiring the current password, an attacker who gains access to an authenticated session could change the password and lock out the legitimate user.
2. **Session Hijacking**: If an attacker hijacks an active session, they could potentially change the password without needing to know the current one. Requiring the current password prevents this.

## Practical Example
When a user requests to change their password, the application should prompt them to enter their current password followed by the new password. This ensures that the request is legitimate.
