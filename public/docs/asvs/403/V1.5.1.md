# Input and Output Requirements

> Verify that input and output requirements clearly define how to handle and process data based on type, content, and applicable laws, regulations, and other policy compliance.

## Objective
Ensure that data handling and processing practices are well-defined and compliant with relevant laws, regulations, and policies.

## Rationale
Having clear input and output requirements helps ensure that data is handled securely and consistently throughout the application. This prevents data mishandling, which could lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Properly defining how data should be processed based on its type and content helps in implementing appropriate security controls and safeguards. This approach minimizes the risk of data exposure and ensures that the application adheres to best practices and compliance standards.
