*V1.5 Input and Output Architecture*

# Input and Output Requirements

> Verify that input and output requirements clearly define how to handle and process data based on type, content, and applicable laws, regulations, and other policy compliance.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all data inputs and outputs are handled according to predefined standards that comply with relevant laws, regulations, and organizational policies. This includes specifying how different types of data should be processed, stored, and transmitted.

## Rationale
Clearly defined input and output requirements help to:
- **Ensure compliance**: Adhere to laws and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other industry-specific standards.
- **Enhance data integrity**: Ensure that data is accurately processed and maintained.
- **Improve security**: Protect against various attacks by properly validating and sanitizing inputs and outputs.
- **Facilitate auditing and accountability**: Provide clear guidelines for how data should be handled, making it easier to audit and enforce policies.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Injection Attacks**: Improper handling of inputs can lead to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) where attackers inject malicious code.
- **Data Leakage**: Inadequate handling of outputs can result in sensitive data being exposed or leaked.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with data handling regulations can result in legal penalties and reputational damage.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Define specific input validation rules for different types of data (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, payment information).
- Implement output encoding and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and data leakage.
- Ensure that all data processing activities comply with applicable regulations, such as encrypting sensitive data during transmission and storage.

For example, when handling user input for a registration form, the organization should:
- Validate email addresses using a regular expression to ensure they conform to standard email formats.
- Sanitize all input fields to remove any potentially malicious content.
- Encode output to prevent XSS attacks when displaying user data on web pages.
- Encrypt sensitive data like passwords and personal information both in transit and at rest.

By clearly defining and adhering to input and output requirements, organizations can protect data integrity, ensure regulatory compliance, and enhance overall application security.
