# Input Validation on a Trusted Service Layer

> Verify that input validation is enforced on a trusted service layer.

## Objective
Ensure that all input validation occurs on a server-side, trusted service layer rather than on the client side or untrusted components.

## Rationale
Validating input on a trusted service layer ensures that all input data is properly checked for correctness, format, and safety before it is processed by the application. Client-side validation can be bypassed or manipulated by attackers, making server-side validation essential for security. This practice helps prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, ensuring that only safe and expected data is processed by the application.

## Practical Example
Imagine a web application where users submit their email addresses for newsletter subscriptions. If input validation is only performed on the client side using JavaScript, an attacker can easily bypass this validation by disabling JavaScript or using tools like Burp Suite to modify the HTTP request. By enforcing input validation on the server side, you ensure that even if client-side validation is bypassed, the server will still check the email format and reject invalid submissions.

Example of Server-Side Input Validation in Node.js with Express:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const validator = require('validator');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/subscribe', (req, res) => {
    const email = req.body.email;
    
    if (!validator.isEmail(email)) {
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid email format');
    }
    
    // Proceed with subscription logic
    res.send('Subscribed successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `validator.isEmail(email)` function checks the format of the email address on the server side, ensuring that only valid email addresses are processed. This approach prevents attackers from submitting malformed or malicious input, thereby enhancing the security of the application.
