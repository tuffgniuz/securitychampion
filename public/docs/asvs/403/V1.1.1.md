# Secure Software Development Lifecycle

> Verify the use of a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) that addresses security in all stages of development.

## Objective
Ensure that security considerations are integrated throughout the entire software development process, from initial design to deployment and maintenance.

## Rationale
Incorporating security into every phase of the SDLC helps identify and mitigate potential security risks early, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing the overall security of the application. A secure SDLC promotes best practices and ensures that security is a fundamental component of the development process, rather than an afterthought.

**Key Aspects of a Secure SDLC**:
1. **Planning**: Include security requirements and risk assessments during project planning.
2. **Design**: Perform threat modeling and design reviews to identify potential security issues.
3. **Implementation**: Follow secure coding practices and use automated tools to detect vulnerabilities.
4. **Testing**: Conduct security testing, including static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and code reviews.
5. **Deployment**: Ensure secure deployment practices and configuration management.
6. **Maintenance**: Regularly update and patch the application to address new security threats and vulnerabilities.

By adhering to a secure SDLC, organizations can build applications that are more resilient to attacks and better protect user data and privacy.
