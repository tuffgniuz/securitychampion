# High-Level Architecture and Connected Services

> Verify the definition and security analysis of the application's high-level architecture and all connected remote services.

## Objective
Ensure a clear understanding and security assessment of the application's overall architecture and its interactions with external services.

## Rationale
Having a well-defined and analyzed high-level architecture helps in identifying potential security weaknesses and implementing appropriate controls. It ensures that all parts of the application and its connections are secure, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

**Key Points**:
- **Architecture Definition**: Document the structure and components of the application.
- **Security Analysis**: Assess the security implications of the architecture and its interactions with external services.

By thoroughly defining and analyzing the application's architecture, development teams can better understand the security landscape and take proactive measures to protect the system from potential threats.
