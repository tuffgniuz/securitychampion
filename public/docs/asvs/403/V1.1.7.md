# Secure Coding Checklist Availability

> Verify the availability of a secure coding checklist, security requirements, guidelines, or policies for all developers and testers.

## Objective
Ensure that all team members have access to essential security information and best practices to implement secure coding.

## Rationale
Providing a secure coding checklist and guidelines ensures that developers and testers follow best practices and security requirements throughout the development process. This promotes a consistent approach to security, reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities, and fosters a culture of security awareness within the team. By having these resources readily available, teams can more easily integrate security into their workflows, making it an inherent part of the development lifecycle rather than an afterthought.

**Key Points**:
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that all developers and testers can easily access the secure coding checklist and guidelines.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The checklist should cover all relevant security practices and requirements for the application.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the checklist and guidelines up-to-date with the latest security trends and threats to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.

By implementing this requirement, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches caused by common coding errors and oversight.
