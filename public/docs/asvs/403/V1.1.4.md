# Documentation of Trust Boundaries

> Verify documentation and justification of all the application's trust boundaries, components, and significant data flows.

## Objective
Ensure that the applicationâ€™s trust boundaries, key components, and data flows are well-documented and justified to understand and manage security risks effectively.

## Rationale
Documenting trust boundaries, components, and data flows helps in identifying potential security risks and designing appropriate controls. It provides a clear understanding of where sensitive data is processed and transmitted, which is crucial for protecting it against unauthorized access and ensuring secure communication between different parts of the application.

## Practical Example
For an application that handles user data and interacts with external services, documentation might include:
- **Trust Boundaries**: Define the boundaries between the internal network and the external network where data enters or leaves the system.
- **Components**: List all major components such as web servers, databases, and third-party services.
- **Data Flows**: Illustrate how data moves between components, including where encryption is used and where sensitive data is stored or processed.

By maintaining this documentation, the development and security teams can better manage and mitigate security risks, ensuring that all parts of the application are adequately protected.
