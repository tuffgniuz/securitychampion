*V1.8 Data Protection and Privacy Architecture*

# Protection Level Requirements

> Verify that all protection levels have an associated set of protection requirements, such as encryption requirements, integrity requirements, retention, privacy and other confidentiality requirements, and that these are applied in the architecture.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that each level of data protection has clear and specific requirements. This includes encryption, data integrity, retention policies, and privacy controls, which are essential for maintaining the security and confidentiality of sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.

## Rationale
Having well-defined protection requirements for each level of data helps to:
- **Enhance data security**: Ensures that data is appropriately protected based on its sensitivity and value.
- **Ensure compliance**: Aligns data handling practices with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements.
- **Improve risk management**: Allows organizations to apply suitable controls to mitigate risks associated with different types of data.
- **Facilitate auditing and accountability**: Provides a clear framework for verifying that data protection measures are implemented and maintained.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Data Breaches**: Inadequate protection can lead to unauthorized access, exposing sensitive data to attackers.
- **Data Corruption**: Lack of integrity controls can result in tampered or corrupted data, impacting data reliability and trustworthiness.
- **Non-Compliance Penalties**: Failure to comply with data protection regulations can lead to legal penalties and reputational damage.
- **Insider Threats**: Insufficient data access controls can allow insiders to misuse or leak sensitive information.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- **Define protection levels**: Classify data into different levels based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, highly confidential).
- **Establish requirements**: For each level, define specific protection requirements, such as using AES-256 encryption for highly confidential data, implementing checksums or hashes for data integrity, and setting retention periods based on regulatory needs.
- **Apply and enforce controls**: Implement the defined protection measures within the data architecture, ensuring they are consistently applied across all systems and processes.

For example, an organization handling personal data might classify it as confidential. The associated protection requirements could include encrypting the data both at rest and in transit, regularly reviewing access logs, and ensuring data is only retained for as long as necessary to comply with privacy regulations.

By defining and implementing comprehensive protection requirements, organizations can better safeguard sensitive data, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with applicable laws and policies.
