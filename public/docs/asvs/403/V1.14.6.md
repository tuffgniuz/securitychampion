# Avoid Deprecated Client-Side Technologies

> Verify the application does not use unsupported, insecure, or deprecated client-side technologies such as NSAPI plugins, Flash, Shockwave, ActiveX, Silverlight, NACL, or client-side Java applets.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that applications avoid using deprecated or insecure client-side technologies. These technologies are often no longer supported or updated, making them vulnerable to security exploits.

## Rationale
Using deprecated or insecure technologies can expose applications to significant security risks, including:
- **Vulnerabilities**: Deprecated technologies often have known vulnerabilities that are no longer being patched.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Modern browsers and platforms may not support these outdated technologies, leading to functionality issues.
- **Increased Attack Surface**: Deprecated technologies can provide an entry point for attackers to exploit other parts of the application.

## What you should do
1. **Review and Update Technologies**: Regularly review the technologies used in your application and replace any deprecated or insecure components with modern, supported alternatives.
2. **Use HTML5 and Modern JavaScript Frameworks**: Replace deprecated technologies with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that are actively maintained and supported.
3. **Implement Security Best Practices**: Ensure your client-side code adheres to current security best practices, including regular updates and patches.

### Example
- **Identify Deprecated Technologies**: Scan your application's codebase for the use of deprecated technologies such as Flash or ActiveX.
- **Replace with Modern Alternatives**: Replace Flash with HTML5 for video playback, and replace ActiveX with modern JavaScript libraries for interactive content.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your application remains secure, compatible with modern platforms, and free from vulnerabilities associated with deprecated technologies.
