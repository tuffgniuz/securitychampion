# Single Vetted Authentication Mechanism

> Verify that the application uses a single vetted authentication mechanism that is known to be secure, can be extended to include strong authentication, and has sufficient logging and monitoring to detect account abuse or breaches.

## Objective
Ensure the application uses a secure, reliable authentication mechanism that supports strong authentication methods and has capabilities to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

## Rationale
Using a single vetted authentication mechanism simplifies the security architecture and ensures that authentication processes are consistent and robust. A well-tested and secure authentication mechanism reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and can be easily extended to incorporate stronger authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA). Additionally, having sufficient logging and monitoring helps detect and mitigate account abuse or breaches in real-time, enhancing the overall security posture of the application.

**Key Points**:
- **Consistency**: A single authentication mechanism ensures uniform security controls across the application.
- **Security**: Vetted mechanisms are thoroughly tested, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.
- **Extensibility**: The ability to add stronger authentication methods as needed.
- **Monitoring**: Sufficient logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

By implementing a single vetted authentication mechanism, organizations can ensure that their authentication processes are secure, scalable, and capable of detecting potential security threats effectively.
