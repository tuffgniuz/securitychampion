*V2.1 Password Security*

# Allow Any Printable Unicode Character in Passwords

> Verify that any printable Unicode character, including language-neutral characters such as spaces and Emojis, are permitted in passwords.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to enhance password security by allowing users to create passwords with a wide variety of characters. This increases the complexity and uniqueness of passwords, making them more resistant to guessing and brute-force attacks.

## Rationale
Permitting any printable Unicode character, including spaces and Emojis, allows users to create more complex and memorable passwords. This flexibility can lead to stronger passwords, as users can use characters from different languages, symbols, and even Emojis, thereby increasing the overall security of their passwords.

## What You Should Do
1. **Support Unicode Characters**: Ensure your application supports the use of any printable Unicode character in passwords, including symbols, letters from various languages, spaces, and Emojis.
2. **Update Password Policies**: Update your password policies to reflect the acceptance of any printable Unicode characters, providing users with the flexibility to create strong and unique passwords.
3. **Test Input Handling**: Thoroughly test your password input handling to ensure it correctly processes and stores all supported Unicode characters without introducing security vulnerabilities.

### Summary
By allowing any printable Unicode character in passwords, you enable users to create stronger, more diverse passwords, thereby enhancing the overall security of your application. This approach increases password complexity and makes it harder for attackers to compromise user accounts through brute-force or guessing attacks.
