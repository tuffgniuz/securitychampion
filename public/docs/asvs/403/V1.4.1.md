# Trusted Enforcement Points

> Verify that trusted enforcement points, such as access control gateways, servers, and serverless functions, enforce access controls. Never enforce access controls on the client.

## Objective
Ensure that access controls are enforced on the server side to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation by clients.

## Rationale
Access controls should always be enforced on trusted server-side components rather than on the client side. Client-side enforcement is vulnerable to bypassing and manipulation by attackers. If access controls are enforced on the client, an attacker can modify the client code to bypass these controls, gaining unauthorized access to restricted resources. Server-side enforcement ensures that all access control decisions are made in a secure, controlled environment, preventing unauthorized access even if the client is compromised.

## Key Points
- **Trusted Enforcement**: Use server-side mechanisms to enforce access controls.
- **Client-Side Risks**: Client-side enforcement can be easily bypassed or manipulated by attackers.

By ensuring that access controls are enforced on trusted server-side components, organizations can protect their applications from unauthorized access and maintain a robust security posture.

# CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
CWE-602 occurs when security decisions are enforced on the client side rather than the server side. This can lead to vulnerabilities because client-side controls can be bypassed or manipulated by attackers.
