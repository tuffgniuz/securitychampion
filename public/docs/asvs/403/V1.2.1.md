# Use of Low-Privilege Accounts

> Verify the use of unique or special low-privilege operating system accounts for all application components, services, and servers.

## Objective
Ensure that each application component, service, and server operates under a low-privilege account to minimize the potential damage from a security breach.

## Rationale
Using low-privilege accounts limits the access and capabilities of application components and services. This containment strategy helps prevent attackers from gaining extensive control if they compromise one part of the system. By restricting privileges, the impact of any security breach is minimized, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to critical system resources and sensitive data. This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security best practice.

By following this requirement, developers and system administrators can create a more secure environment that reduces the attack surface and contains potential breaches.
