# Enable Paste Functionality

> Ensure that "paste" functionality, browser password helpers, and external password managers are permitted.

## Objective
Allow users to use password managers and browser features to securely paste and manage their passwords.

## Rationale
Disabling paste functionality or blocking password managers can frustrate users and lead to insecure behaviors, such as reusing passwords or writing them down. Allowing these tools helps users create and use strong, unique passwords, enhancing overall security.

- **Password Reuse**: Preventing paste functionality can lead users to reuse simple passwords they can remember, increasing the risk of password reuse attacks.
- **User Frustration**: Blocking password managers can cause frustration, leading to insecure practices like writing down passwords or using weak, easily guessable passwords.

## Key Takeaways
- Allow paste functionality to facilitate the use of strong, unique passwords.
- Support browser password helpers and external password managers to enhance user security practices.
- Avoid security measures that inadvertently encourage poor password behaviors【75:0†source】.
