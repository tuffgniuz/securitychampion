# No Composition Rules

> Ensure there are no rules limiting the types of characters in passwords. Do not require specific combinations of upper/lower case letters, numbers, or special characters.

## Objective
Allow users to create passwords with any combination of characters, promoting the use of strong and memorable passwords.

## Rationale
Requiring specific character combinations, such as upper/lower case letters, numbers, or special characters, can lead to predictable patterns. For example, users might create passwords like "Password1!" to meet these requirements, which are easier to guess. Longer passwords or passphrases without such rules are often more secure and memorable. Special characters do not inherently make a password more secure; what matters more is the overall length and unpredictability of the password.

**Relationship with Attacks**:
1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Unrestricted character combinations result in more unpredictable passwords, reducing the effectiveness of brute force attacks.
2. **Password Guessing**: Without composition rules, users avoid predictable patterns, making passwords harder to guess.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Attackers often exploit predictable patterns created by composition rules, such as substituting "@" for "a" or "!" for "1", which do not significantly enhance security.

## Code Example (TypeScript)

Here is a TypeScript example that demonstrates a simple password validation without composition rules, focusing on length:

```typescript
/**
 * Validates if the given password meets the security requirements.
 * @param password - The password to validate.
 * @returns boolean - True if the password is valid, false otherwise.
 */
function isPasswordValid(password: string): boolean {
    // Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
    const condensedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

    // Check if the password length is within the allowed range
    const length = condensedPassword.length;
    return length >= 12 && length <= 128;
}

// Example usage
const password = "mysecurepassword";
if (isPasswordValid(password)) {
    console.log("Password is valid.");
} else {
    console.log("Password must be between 12 and 128 characters long.");
}
```

## Key Takeaways
- Do not enforce specific character combination rules for passwords.
- Focus on password length and overall complexity for stronger security.
- Special characters do not inherently make passwords more secure; unpredictability and length are more critical factors.
- Encourage users to create long, memorable passwords or passphrases without restrictive composition rules.
