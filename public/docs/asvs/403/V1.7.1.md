*V1.7 Errors, Logging, and Auditing Architecture*

# Common Logging Format

> Ensure that a common logging format and approach is used across the system.

## Objective
To establish a standardized logging format and methodology across all components of the system to facilitate consistent log management, analysis, and correlation.

## Rationale
A unified logging approach is crucial for effective monitoring, detection, and troubleshooting of security events. By implementing a common logging format, developers and security teams can ensure that logs are consistently structured, making it easier to analyze and correlate data across different system components. This enhances the ability to detect anomalies, respond to incidents, and conduct forensic investigations. Integrating this requirement into the architecture and design phases ensures that logging practices are standardized from the outset, providing a robust foundation for ongoing security monitoring and auditing.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be implemented during the architecture and design phases of any system that requires logging for security, monitoring, or auditing purposes. It is especially important for applications that handle sensitive data or are subject to regulatory compliance. The standardized logging approach should be revisited during security reviews and updates to ensure it remains effective and comprehensive.
