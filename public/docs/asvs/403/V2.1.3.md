# No Password Truncation

> Verify that password truncation is not performed. However, consecutive multiple spaces may be replaced by a single space.

## Objective
Ensure that the entire user-provided password is used for authentication, preserving its full complexity and security.

## Rationale
Password truncation reduces the effective length of the password, diminishing its security. If only a portion of the password is used, it makes the password easier to guess or brute-force. Additionally, truncation can lead to confusion for users who believe they are using a longer, more secure password. Allowing consecutive spaces to be replaced by a single space helps to normalize input without significantly affecting password security.

**Relationship with Attacks**:
1. **Brute Force Attacks**: If a password is truncated, the actual length used for authentication is shorter, making it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force the password. For example, if a password is truncated to 8 characters, the number of possible combinations is vastly reduced compared to a longer password.
2. **Dictionary Attacks**: Truncated passwords may align more closely with common words or phrases found in password dictionaries, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks.

## Practical Example
When a user sets or updates their password, the application should ensure that the entire password, after condensing consecutive spaces, is stored and used for authentication without any truncation.

## Code Example (TypeScript)
Here is a TypeScript example that demonstrates how to enforce this requirement:

```typescript
/**
 * Checks if the given password meets the security requirements.
 * @param password - The password to validate.
 * @returns boolean - True if the password meets the requirements, false otherwise.
 */
function isPasswordValid(password: string): boolean {
    // Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
    const condensedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

    // Ensure the entire condensed password is used without truncation
    const length = condensedPassword.length;
    return length >= 12 && length <= 128;
}

// Example usage
const password = "this  is  a  secure  password";
if (isPasswordValid(password)) {
    console.log("Password is valid.");
} else {
    console.log("Password must be between 12 and 128 characters long.");
}
```
