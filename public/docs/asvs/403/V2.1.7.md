*V2.1 Password Security*

# Check Passwords Against Breached Passwords

> Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally (such as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's password policy) or using an external API. If using an API, a zero-knowledge proof or other mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password is not sent or used in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password is breached, the application must require the user to set a new non-breached password.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to prevent users from using passwords that have previously been compromised in data breaches. This helps protect user accounts from being easily accessible through credential stuffing attacks.

## Rationale
Checking passwords against a list of known breached passwords ensures that users do not reuse passwords that are already known to be insecure. This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise through credential stuffing, where attackers use lists of breached passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

## What You Should Do
1. **Implement Local Checks**: Maintain a local database of common breached passwords and check user-submitted passwords against this list during registration, login, and password change processes.
2. **Use External APIs**: Integrate with an external API that provides breached password checking, ensuring that a zero-knowledge proof or similar mechanism is used to avoid sending plain text passwords over the network.
3. **Enforce Password Changes**: If a password is found to be breached, require the user to set a new, secure password that is not on the breached list.

### Summary
By verifying passwords against a list of breached passwords, you enhance the security of user accounts by preventing the use of passwords that are already known to be compromised. This proactive approach helps protect against credential stuffing attacks and ensures users are creating secure, unique passwords.
