# Breached Password Checking

> Check passwords during account registration, login, and password changes against a list of known breached passwords. If a password has been compromised, the user must choose a new, secure password.

## Objective
Ensure that users do not use passwords that are known to be compromised, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to the use of weak or previously exposed passwords.

## Rationale
Breached passwords are those that have been exposed in data breaches and are therefore well-known to attackers. Using such passwords significantly increases the risk of account compromise. By checking against a list of breached passwords, the application can prompt users to choose stronger, unique passwords, enhancing overall security.

### Attack Vectors
1. **Credential Stuffing**: Attackers use lists of breached passwords in combination with common usernames to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
2. **Brute Force Attacks**: Breached passwords are often included in brute force attack dictionaries, making them easier targets.

## Libraries and APIs for Checking Breached Passwords
1. **Have I Been Pwned API**
   - **Languages**: Available for multiple languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java.
   - **Description**: Allows checking if a password has been compromised in a data breach without sending the plain text password.
   - **Website**: [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3)
2. **Pwned Passwords**
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby.
   - **Description**: Provides a list of breached passwords that can be integrated locally or through the API.
   - **Website**: [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
3. **HIBPwned (Node.js)**
   - **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js).
   - **Description**: Node.js client for Have I Been Pwned API.

4. **hibp (Python)**
   - **Language**: Python.
   - **Description**: Python client for Have I Been Pwned API.
   - **PyPI**: [hibp](https://pypi.org/project/hibp/)
5. **breach-check (Java)**
   - **Language**: Java.

## Secure Password Handling Libraries
1. **Argon2 (Python, Node.js, Java)**
   - **Languages**: Python, Node.js, Java.
   - **Description**: A secure hashing algorithm that can be used to hash passwords before checking against a breach list.
   - **Websites**:

2. **BCrypt (Python, Node.js, Java)**
   - **Languages**: Python, Node.js, Java.
   - **Description**: A password-hashing function designed to be computationally expensive to thwart brute-force attacks.
   - **Websites**:
     - [bcrypt (Python)](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/)
     - [bcrypt (Node.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
     - [jBCrypt (Java)](https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/)

## Key Takeaways
- Ensure passwords are checked against a list of known breached passwords during account-related operations.
- Utilize APIs like Have I Been Pwned or local libraries to perform these checks securely.
- Implement zero-knowledge proof mechanisms if using an external API to ensure plaintext passwords are not exposed.
- Enforcing this policy helps prevent the use of compromised passwords, reducing the risk of credential stuffing and brute force attacks.
