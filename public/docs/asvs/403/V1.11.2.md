# Synchronization of State in High-Value Business Logic Flows

> Verify that all high-value business logic flows, including authentication, session management, and access control, do not share unsynchronized state.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that high-value business logic flows are not reliant on unsynchronized states. This means that components involved in these critical operations should maintain a consistent and synchronized state to prevent inconsistencies and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Rationale
Ensuring that high-value business logic flows do not share unsynchronized states helps to:
- **Maintain Consistency**: Synchronized states ensure that all components have a consistent view of the system, reducing errors and inconsistencies.
- **Enhance Security**: Unsynchronized states can lead to race conditions and other vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
- **Improve Reliability**: Synchronized states contribute to the overall reliability of the application, ensuring that critical operations are performed correctly.
- **Prevent Data Corruption**: Synchronized states help in preventing data corruption by ensuring that changes are propagated correctly across all components.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement distributed transactions to ensure that all parts of a business logic flow are either completed successfully or rolled back together.
- Use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one process can modify a critical resource at a time.
- Implement state management systems that ensure consistency across distributed systems, such as using consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft.

For example, in an e-commerce application, the process of placing an order might involve multiple steps such as verifying inventory, processing payment, and updating order status. Ensuring that these steps do not share unsynchronized state could involve using a distributed transaction system to guarantee that all steps are completed successfully. If any step fails, the transaction is rolled back, maintaining a consistent state across the system.

By ensuring that high-value business logic flows do not share unsynchronized states, organizations can improve the security, reliability, and consistency of their critical operations.
