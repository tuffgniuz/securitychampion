*V2.1 Password Security*

# Users Can Change Their Password

> Verify users can change their password.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that users have the ability to update their passwords. This is crucial for maintaining account security, especially if a password is compromised or the user believes it may have been.

## Rationale
Allowing users to change their passwords provides several security benefits:
- **Mitigates Risks**: Users can immediately change their passwords if they suspect that their account has been compromised.
- **Enhances Security**: Regular password changes can reduce the likelihood of long-term password exposure.
- **User Control**: Empowers users to manage their own security by updating passwords as needed.

## What You Should Do
1. **Provide a Password Change Feature**: Ensure your application has a straightforward and accessible process for users to change their passwords.
2. **Secure the Password Change Process**: Implement appropriate security measures to verify the userâ€™s identity before allowing a password change (e.g., re-entering the current password, multi-factor authentication).
3. **Notify Users**: Send notifications to users when their passwords are changed, alerting them to any unauthorized changes.

## Summary
By verifying that users can change their passwords, you enhance the security and usability of your application. This capability is a fundamental aspect of maintaining user trust and protecting accounts from unauthorized access.
