# Allow Users to Change Their Password

> Verify that users can change their password.

## Objective
Ensure that users have the ability to change their password at any time, enhancing security by allowing them to respond to potential threats or personal preference changes.

## Rationale
Allowing users to change their passwords is a fundamental security feature. It enables users to proactively manage their account security by updating their password if they suspect it has been compromised or simply to improve their password strength. This capability is essential for maintaining user trust and securing accounts against potential attacks.

1. **Account Takeover**: If a userâ€™s password is compromised, the ability to change it quickly can prevent an attacker from maintaining access to the account.
2. **Phishing Attacks**: Users who fall victim to phishing scams can mitigate damage by changing their password immediately after realizing the compromise.
3. **Brute Force Attacks**: Regularly changing passwords can help reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks by invalidating previously guessed passwords.

## Practical Example
Provide an interface in your application where users can update their password. Ensure that the process is secure and user-friendly.

## Code Example
Here is a TypeScript example that demonstrates how to implement password change functionality:
```typescript
/**
 * Validates the password change request.
 * @param currentPassword - The user's current password.
 * @param newPassword - The new password to set.
 * @returns boolean - True if the password change is valid, false otherwise.
 */
function validatePasswordChange(currentPassword: string, newPassword: string): boolean {
    // Mock function to check if the current password is correct
    const isCurrentPasswordValid = (password: string) => {
        // Placeholder for actual password validation logic
        return password === "userCurrentPassword"; // Replace with actual password validation
    };

    // Ensure the new password meets security requirements
    const isNewPasswordValid = (password: string) => {
        // Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
        const condensedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
        // Check password length
        const length = condensedPassword.length;
        return length >= 12 && length <= 128;
    };

    // Validate current password and new password
    return isCurrentPasswordValid(currentPassword) && isNewPasswordValid(newPassword);
}

// Example usage
const currentPassword = "userCurrentPassword";
const newPassword = "New Secure Password 123!";
if (validatePasswordChange(currentPassword, newPassword)) {
    console.log("Password change is valid.");
    // Proceed with password change logic
} else {
    console.log("Password change is invalid.");
}
```
