# Functional Security Constraints in User Stories

> Verify that all user stories and features contain functional security constraints, such as "As a user, I should be able to view and edit my profile. I should not be able to view or edit anyone else's profile."

## Objective
Ensure that security considerations are included in user stories and features, specifying what users can and cannot do to protect against unauthorized access and actions.

## Rationale
Including functional security constraints in user stories helps developers and testers understand the security requirements and implement appropriate controls. It ensures that security is considered from the beginning and that features are designed to prevent unauthorized actions and access.

## Practical Example
A user story for a profile management feature might include:
- **User Story**: As a user, I should be able to view and edit my profile information.
- **Functional Security Constraint**: I should not be able to view or edit the profile information of other users.

By specifying this constraint, developers know to implement access controls that restrict profile viewing and editing to the profile owner only.

## Key Takeaways
- Integrate functional security constraints in all user stories and features.
- Clearly specify what actions users can and cannot perform to prevent unauthorized access.
- Including security constraints from the beginning helps ensure secure design and implementation.
