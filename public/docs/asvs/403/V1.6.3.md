*V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture*

# Key and Password Replacement Process

> Verify that all keys and passwords are replaceable and are part of a well-defined process to re-encrypt sensitive data.

## Objective
To design and implement a system architecture that allows for the secure replacement of cryptographic keys and passwords, ensuring that sensitive data can be re-encrypted without exposing it to unauthorized access.

## Rationale
Including a process for key and password replacement in the system architecture ensures that compromised or outdated keys and passwords can be updated without disrupting service or compromising data security. This proactive measure helps mitigate risks associated with key exposure, ensuring the continued integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Integrating this into the architecture and design phase allows for seamless transitions and maintains robust security postures.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be implemented during the architecture and design phases of any system utilizing cryptographic keys or passwords for securing data. It is crucial for systems that handle sensitive information, such as financial transactions, personal data, or health records. The process should be revisited during threat modeling and security reviews to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date with emerging threats and compliance requirements.
