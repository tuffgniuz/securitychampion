*V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture*

# Replaceable Keys and Passwords

> Verify that all keys and passwords are replaceable and are part of a well-defined process to re-encrypt sensitive data.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that cryptographic keys and passwords can be replaced when necessary and that there is a defined process for re-encrypting sensitive data. This is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data, especially if keys or passwords are compromised or need to be rotated.

## Rationale
Having replaceable keys and passwords with a well-defined re-encryption process helps to:
- **Maintain data security**: Ensure that sensitive data remains protected even if cryptographic keys or passwords are compromised.
- **Facilitate key rotation**: Regularly rotating keys and passwords enhances security by limiting the amount of data exposed if a key is compromised.
- **Enable incident response**: Provide a clear procedure for responding to key compromise incidents, minimizing the impact on data security.
- **Ensure compliance**: Adhere to security best practices and regulatory requirements that mandate key and password rotation and re-encryption processes.

### Attack Vectors
- **Key Compromise**: If keys are compromised and cannot be replaced, attackers could decrypt sensitive data, leading to data breaches.
- **Stale Keys**: Using old or weak keys can make encryption vulnerable to attacks, compromising the security of the encrypted data.
- **Insufficient Key Management**: Without a defined process for key replacement and re-encryption, organizations may struggle to maintain the security of their encrypted data over time.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement a key management system that supports key rotation and provides a mechanism for securely replacing keys.
- Define and document a process for re-encrypting sensitive data when keys are replaced, ensuring that data remains secure throughout the transition.
- Regularly audit and test the key replacement and re-encryption process to ensure it works effectively and securely.

For example, a cloud storage service might use a key management system that automatically rotates encryption keys every 90 days. When keys are rotated, the system re-encrypts stored data with the new keys, ensuring continuous protection. The process is documented and tested regularly to ensure it can be executed smoothly without data loss or downtime.

By ensuring that keys and passwords are replaceable and part of a well-defined re-encryption process, organizations can maintain the security of their encrypted data and reduce the risk of data breaches.
