# Password Length

Ensure that user passwords are at least 12 characters long, even after multiple spaces are combined into one.

## Objective
The aim is to enforce a minimum password length to improve security by making passwords harder to guess or crack through brute force attacks.

## Rationale
Longer passwords provide a higher level of security by increasing the number of possible combinations, making it more challenging for attackers to break the password. Attackers might use tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper, or other brute force and dictionary attack software to systematically try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

By requiring passwords to be at least 12 characters long, the complexity of cracking the password increases exponentially. This makes brute force attacks computationally impractical for most attackers, as it significantly extends the time required to guess the correct password.

## Practical Example
When a user sets or updates their password, the application should verify that the password length, after condensing any consecutive spaces into a single space, is at least 12 characters. For instance, if a user enters a password with multiple spaces like "this is a password", it should be treated as "this is a password" for the length check.

## Code Example
```typescript
/**
 * Checks if the given password is valid based on the length requirement.
 * @param password - The password to validate.
 * @returns boolean - True if the password is valid, false otherwise.
 */
function isPasswordValid(password: string): boolean {
    // Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
    const condensedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

    // Check if the password is at least 12 characters long
    return condensedPassword.length >= 12;
}

// Example usage
const password = "this  is  a  password";
if (isPasswordValid(password)) {
    console.log("Password is valid.");
} else {
    console.log("Password must be at least 12 characters long.");
}
```

## Key Takeaways
- Ensure user passwords are at least 12 characters in length.
- Combine multiple consecutive spaces into one before checking the length.
- Enforcing this policy helps enhance security by making passwords more resistant to brute force attacks. Attackers using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper will face exponentially increased computational difficulty, significantly extending the time and resources required to crack the password.
