*V2.1 Password Security*

# User Set Password Length

> Verify that user set passwords are at least 12 characters in length (after multiple spaces are combined).

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to enhance password security by ensuring users create sufficiently long passwords. Longer passwords are more resilient to brute force attacks, making it harder for attackers to guess or crack them.

## Rationale
Longer passwords provide greater security because they increase the number of possible combinations, thereby making it more difficult for attackers to succeed with brute force methods. By enforcing a minimum password length of 12 characters, you significantly improve the security of user accounts.

## What You Should Do
1. **Enforce Minimum Length**: Ensure that the password creation and update processes in your application enforce a minimum length of 12 characters.
2. **Educate Users**: Inform users about the importance of creating long, complex passwords to enhance their security.
3. **Combine Spaces**: Allow spaces in passwords, but treat multiple consecutive spaces as a single space to prevent trivial length padding.

## Summary
By enforcing a minimum password length of 12 characters, you greatly enhance the security of user accounts in your application. This requirement helps prevent brute force attacks and encourages users to create more secure passwords.
