# View Masked Passwords

> Allow users to temporarily view the entire masked password or the last typed character on platforms that do not have this functionality built-in.

## Objective
Provide users with the option to see their password while typing to reduce errors and improve the user experience.

## Rationale
Allowing users to view their passwords temporarily helps prevent typos and ensures they enter their intended password, reducing frustration and the need for password resets. This functionality is particularly important on platforms that do not natively support viewing masked passwords.

## React Example
Here is a React component that allows users to toggle the visibility of their password:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const PasswordInput = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);

  const handlePasswordChange = (e) => {
    setPassword(e.target.value);
  };

  const toggleShowPassword = () => {
    setShowPassword(!showPassword);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
      <input
        type={showPassword ? 'text' : 'password'}
        id="password"
        value={password}
        onChange={handlePasswordChange}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={toggleShowPassword}>
        {showPassword ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PasswordInput;
```

## Key Takeaways
- Provide an option for users to temporarily view their passwords to reduce entry errors.
- Enhance the user experience by allowing flexibility in password visibility.
- Implementing this feature helps prevent typos and ensures users can verify their password entries.
