*V2.1 Password Security*

# View Masked Passwords

> Verify that the user can choose to either temporarily view the entire masked password, or temporarily view the last typed character of the password on platforms that do not have this as built-in functionality.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to enhance user experience and reduce errors during password entry by allowing users to temporarily view their masked passwords. This helps users ensure they have entered their passwords correctly.

## Rationale
Masked password fields help protect passwords from being seen by others, but they can also lead to user frustration and increased errors during password entry. By allowing users to temporarily view their passwords, you:
- **Reduce Entry Errors**: Help users verify their password entry, reducing the likelihood of errors and the need for password resets.
- **Improve Usability**: Enhance the user experience by providing an option to view the password without compromising security.
- **Balance Security and Convenience**: Maintain security while offering a convenient way for users to check their passwords.

## What You Should Do
1. **Implement View Option**: Provide an option for users to temporarily view their entire password or the last typed character in the password field.
2. **Ensure Security**: Implement this functionality securely to ensure that the temporary view does not compromise the overall security of the password field.
3. **Educate Users**: Inform users about the option and how to use it to verify their password entries.

## Summary
By allowing users to temporarily view their masked passwords, you improve the usability and accuracy of password entry. This feature helps balance security with user convenience, reducing the likelihood of password entry errors and improving the overall user experience【121:0†source】.
