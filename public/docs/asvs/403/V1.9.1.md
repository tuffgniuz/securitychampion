*V1.9 Communications Architecture*

# Secure Communication

> Verify the application encrypts communications between components, particularly when these components are in different containers, systems, sites, or cloud providers.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all communication between application components is secure, especially when they are distributed across different environments. Encrypting these communications helps protect data from being intercepted or tampered with during transit.

## Rationale
Encrypting communications between components helps to:
- **Ensure Data Confidentiality**: Protects sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized parties during transmission.
- **Ensure Data Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized modifications to the data being transmitted.
- **Enhance Security Posture**: Provides a strong defense against network-based attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Comply with Regulations**: Meets legal and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Unencrypted communications can be intercepted and modified by attackers, leading to data breaches and other security incidents.
- **Eavesdropping**: Attackers can listen to unencrypted communications to steal sensitive information.
- **Data Tampering**: Unencrypted data can be altered during transmission, compromising the integrity of the communication.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all communications between application components.
- Use secure tunnels (such as VPNs) for communication between data centers or cloud environments.
- Ensure that all API calls between components are encrypted.
- Regularly audit and update encryption protocols to ensure they are up-to-date with current security standards.

For example, a microservices architecture can use TLS to encrypt communications between services running in different containers within a Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that data exchanged between services is protected from interception and tampering, regardless of whether the services are on the same physical server or distributed across multiple servers.

By encrypting communications between components, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure that sensitive information is protected during transmission.
