# Auditing Credential Changes

> Verify that all credential changes are subject to logging and review, including login events, failed login events, changes to credentials, and failed attempts to change credentials.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all credential changes are thoroughly audited. This includes logging all related events and making these logs available for review. This helps in detecting unauthorized access attempts and ensuring accountability.

## Rationale
Auditing credential changes helps organizations:
- Detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
- Ensure accountability by keeping a record of all changes and attempts to change credentials.
- Identify and investigate suspicious activities that could indicate a security breach.
- Maintain compliance with security policies and regulations that require thorough logging and monitoring of credential-related events.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement logging for all login attempts, including successful and failed attempts.
- Log all changes to credentials, such as password changes, security question updates, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) modifications.
- Ensure that logs are stored securely and are only accessible to authorized personnel.
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual patterns of credential changes.

For example, if a user tries to change their password multiple times within a short period, this could indicate an attempted brute force attack. By logging these attempts and reviewing the logs, the organization can detect and respond to such activities promptly.

By auditing credential changes, organizations can enhance their security posture, ensure compliance, and protect against unauthorized access.
