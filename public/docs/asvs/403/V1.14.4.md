*V1.14 Configuration Architecture*

# Automated Secure Deployment

> Verify that the build pipeline contains a build step to automatically build and verify the secure deployment of the application, particularly if the application infrastructure is software-defined, such as cloud environment build scripts.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that the deployment process of the application is automated, secure, and verifiable. This involves incorporating automated steps in the build pipeline to build and verify the applicationâ€™s deployment securely.

## Rationale
Automating the deployment process with security checks ensures consistency, reduces human error, and enhances the overall security posture of the application. It allows for:
- **Consistent Deployments**: Ensuring each deployment follows the same secure process.
- **Reduced Human Error**: Automation minimizes the chances of mistakes that can occur with manual deployments.
- **Enhanced Security**: Automatically verifying the deployment process helps identify and mitigate security issues early.
- **Scalability**: Automating deployments allows for easier scaling and management of the infrastructure.

## What you should do
1. **Integrate Automated Build Steps**: Configure your CI/CD pipeline to include steps that automatically build the application.
2. **Verify Deployment**: Implement steps to verify the deployment, such as running security checks, tests, and validations.
3. **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: For cloud environments, use tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager to define and manage infrastructure in a secure, automated manner.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring and logging to track deployment activities and detect anomalies.
