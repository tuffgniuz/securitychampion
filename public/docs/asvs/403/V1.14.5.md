*V1.14 Configuration Architecture*

# Sandbox, Containerize, and Isolate Deployments

> Verify that application deployments adequately sandbox, containerize, and/or isolate at the network level to delay and deter attackers from attacking other applications, especially when they are performing sensitive or dangerous actions such as deserialization.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to enhance the security of application deployments by isolating and containing potentially dangerous operations. This limits the ability of attackers to move laterally and compromise other parts of the system.

## Rationale
By sandboxing, containerizing, and isolating different components and operations, you:
- **Limit Damage**: Contain any breaches to a single component, preventing attackers from spreading to other parts of the application.
- **Enhance Security**: Apply specific security controls tailored to the needs of each component, especially those handling sensitive or dangerous tasks.
- **Improve Management**: Simplify monitoring and management of security policies by segmenting the application into isolated units.

## What you should do
1. **Use Sandboxing**: Implement sandboxing techniques to isolate components, particularly those executing risky operations like deserialization.
2. **Containerize Applications**: Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to deploy applications in isolated environments, ensuring each container has minimal access to other containers and the host system.
3. **Network Isolation**: Configure network policies to isolate different components and limit their communication to only what is necessary.
4. **Apply Security Controls**: Implement strict security controls and policies within each sandbox or container to protect against breaches.

### Example
- **Using Docker for Containerization**:
  Create a Dockerfile to define the environment for a component performing sensitive operations, ensuring it runs in an isolated container.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py"]
```

- **Network Policies in Kubernetes**:
  Define network policies in a Kubernetes cluster to isolate pods and restrict communication.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress: []
  egress: []
```

By sandboxing, containerizing, and isolating your deployments, you can significantly reduce the risk of an attacker compromising multiple parts of your application.
