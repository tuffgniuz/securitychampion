*V1.12 Secure File Upload Architecture*

# Serving User-Uploaded Files

> Verify that user-uploaded files - if required to be displayed or downloaded from the application - are served by either octet stream downloads, or from an unrelated domain, such as a cloud file storage bucket. Implement a suitable Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the risk from XSS vectors or other attacks from the uploaded file.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to protect your application from potential security threats, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, by ensuring that user-uploaded files are handled and served securely.

## Rationale
When users upload files to your application, those files could potentially contain malicious content. If these files are served back to users without proper precautions, attackers can exploit this to run malicious scripts, steal information, or perform other harmful actions.

## What you should do
1. **Serve Files as Octet Streams**: Configure your application to serve files as octet streams to prompt downloads rather than rendering or executing them in the browser.
2. **Use a Separate Domain**: Store and serve user-uploaded files from an unrelated domain, such as a cloud storage bucket (e.g., Amazon S3), to isolate them from your main application.
3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define and enforce a CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded.
