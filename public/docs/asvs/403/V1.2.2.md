# Authenticated Communications Between Components

> Verify that communications between application components, including APIs, middleware, and data layers, are authenticated. Components should have the least necessary privileges needed.

## Objective
Ensure that all communication between application components is authenticated to prevent unauthorized access and maintain secure data exchanges.

## Rationale
Authenticated communications between components help ensure that only legitimate and authorized components can interact with each other, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This security measure ensures that data exchanged between components is protected from interception and tampering.

The **principle of least privilege** (PoLP) is a fundamental security concept that requires each component, service, or user to have only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions. By adhering to PoLP, the system limits the potential damage that could result from a compromised component. If an attacker gains access to a component, the restricted privileges prevent them from accessing other parts of the system or performing unauthorized actions. This containment strategy minimizes the overall impact of security breaches and helps protect critical system resources and sensitive data.

By enforcing authenticated communications and the principle of least privilege, organizations can enhance their application security, ensuring secure and authorized interactions between components while reducing the attack surface and potential damage from security incidents.

## Key Points
- **Authentication**: All inter-component communications must be authenticated to ensure secure interactions.
- **Least Privilege**: Components should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential impact of a compromised component.

By implementing these measures, organizations can enhance the security of their application architecture, protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring secure communication channels between components.
