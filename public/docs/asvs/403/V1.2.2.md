*V1.2 Authentication Architecture*

# Authenticated Communications Between Components

> Verify that communications between application components, including APIs, middleware, and data layers, are authenticated. Components should have the least necessary privileges needed.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all communications between application components are authenticated, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring that components only have the privileges necessary to perform their functions.

## Rationale
Authenticating communications between components helps to:
- Prevent unauthorized access to internal APIs and services.
- Ensure that data exchanged between components is protected from interception and tampering.
- Enforce the principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.
- Enhance overall security by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized components can communicate with each other.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate both the client and server components during communication.
- Use API gateways or service meshes to manage and enforce authentication policies for internal communications.
- Ensure that each component has unique credentials and the minimum necessary permissions to access other components or services.

For instance, if a frontend service needs to communicate with a backend API, mTLS can be used to authenticate both services. The frontend service would present its client certificate, and the backend API would verify it before allowing access. Similarly, the backend API would present its server certificate, which the frontend service would verify to ensure it's communicating with the correct service.

By authenticating communications between components, organizations can ensure that their internal communications are secure and that each component only has access to the resources it needs to function, reducing the overall attack surface of the application.
