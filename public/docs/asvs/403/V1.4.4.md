# Single Vetted Access Control Mechanism

> Verify the application uses a single and well-vetted access control mechanism for accessing protected data and resources. All requests must pass through this single mechanism to avoid copy-paste or insecure alternative paths.

## Objective
Ensure that access control is consistently enforced through a single, secure mechanism, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of bypassing security controls.

## Rationale
Using a single, well-vetted access control mechanism ensures that all access to protected resources is uniformly managed and secured. This prevents the creation of multiple, potentially insecure paths that attackers could exploit to bypass access controls. By funneling all access requests through one vetted mechanism, the application can more effectively enforce security policies, monitor access attempts, and maintain a consistent security posture.

## Practical Example
Consider an application that provides access to sensitive user data. If the application implements multiple methods for accessing this data (e.g., direct database queries, different API endpoints), inconsistencies and security gaps can arise. An attacker might find and exploit a less secure method to gain unauthorized access. By consolidating all access requests through a single, vetted API endpoint that enforces strict access controls, the application ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, and it can uniformly apply security measures such as logging, monitoring, and authentication.

## Key Takeaways
- Use a single, well-vetted access control mechanism for all protected resources.
- Ensure consistency in access control enforcement to prevent security gaps.
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access by eliminating multiple, potentially insecure pathways.

# CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-284) refers to instances where the software does not properly restrict the operations allowed to users or roles. This weakness occurs when the application fails to enforce sufficient access controls, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.

Improper access control can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality. This type of vulnerability is critical because it can result in a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
