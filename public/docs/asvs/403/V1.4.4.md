*V1.4 Access Control Architecture*

# Single Access Control Mechanism

> Verify the application uses a single and well-vetted access control mechanism for accessing protected data and resources. All requests must pass through this single mechanism to avoid copy and paste or insecure alternative paths.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that access control is managed centrally and uniformly. This reduces complexity and the risk of security flaws due to inconsistent or duplicated access control logic.

## Rationale
Using a single, well-vetted access control mechanism helps to:
- **Ensure consistency**: A single mechanism ensures that access control rules are consistently enforced across the application.
- **Prevent security gaps**: Inconsistent or duplicated access control methods can create security gaps that attackers could exploit.
- **Simplify maintenance and auditing**: Centralized access control logic is easier to manage, update, and audit.
- **Enhance security**: Ensures all requests are subject to the same rigorous access control checks, reducing the risk of bypass.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Bypassing Inconsistent Controls**: If different parts of the application use different access control mechanisms, attackers might find and exploit weaker points to gain unauthorized access.
- **Copy and Paste Errors**: When access control logic is duplicated, errors can occur, leading to inconsistencies that attackers can exploit.
- **Insecure Alternative Paths**: Multiple access control mechanisms can create alternative paths that are less secure, providing attackers with opportunities to bypass stronger controls.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement a centralized access control service or library that handles all authorization decisions.
- Ensure that all application components and services use this centralized mechanism to verify access permissions.
- Regularly review and test the access control mechanism to ensure it remains secure and effective.

For example, an application might use an access control library that enforces policies based on roles and permissions. All API endpoints and services would call this library to check if a user is authorized to perform a specific action. This ensures that access control rules are consistently applied, and any changes to the rules are automatically propagated across the entire application.

By centralizing access control, organizations can reduce the risk of insecure alternative paths and ensure that access to sensitive data and resources is managed securely and effectively.
