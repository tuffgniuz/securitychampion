*V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture*

# Client-Side Secret Management

> Ensure that the architecture treats client-side secrets—such as symmetric keys, passwords, or API tokens—as insecure and never uses them to protect or access sensitive data.

## Objective
To design and implement an architecture that avoids relying on client-side secrets for the protection or access of sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of exposure and compromise.

## Rationale
Client-side secrets are inherently insecure because they can be easily accessed or extracted by attackers. Storing sensitive keys, passwords, or tokens on the client side can lead to significant security breaches if these secrets are intercepted. By ensuring that the architecture does not depend on client-side secrets, and instead uses secure server-side methods for protecting and accessing sensitive data, we mitigate the risks of unauthorized access and data leakage. Integrating this consideration during the architecture, design, and threat modeling phases ensures robust security from the ground up.

## When to Implement
This requirement should be implemented during the architecture and design phases of any system that involves sensitive data protection. It is particularly crucial for web and mobile applications that may be vulnerable to client-side attacks. This approach should be reinforced during threat modeling and security reviews to ensure that client-side secrets are not relied upon and that appropriate server-side protections are in place.
