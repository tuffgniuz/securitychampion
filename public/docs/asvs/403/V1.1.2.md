# Threat Modeling for Design Changes

> Verify the use of threat modeling for every design change or sprint planning to identify threats, plan for countermeasures, facilitate appropriate risk responses, and guide security testing.

## Objective
Incorporate threat modeling into the development process to proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats, ensuring that security considerations are addressed during design changes or sprint planning.

## Rationale
Threat modeling helps in understanding the security implications of design changes and new features. By identifying potential threats early, teams can plan appropriate countermeasures and guide security testing efforts effectively. This proactive approach minimizes security risks and ensures that security is integrated into the development lifecycle.

**Key Points**:
- **Identify Threats**: Understand the potential security threats associated with design changes or new features.
- **Plan Countermeasures**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified threats.
- **Facilitate Risk Responses**: Implement appropriate measures to respond to security risks.
- **Guide Security Testing**: Ensure that security testing efforts are aligned with identified threats and risk responses.

## Practical Example
Imagine a team is adding a new user authentication feature to their application. They would perform threat modeling during the design phase to identify potential security threats associated with this new feature. Through this process, they might identify threats such as:

- **Threat**: Brute force attacks on user passwords.
  - **Countermeasure**: Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
- **Threat**: Credential stuffing attacks.
  - **Countermeasure**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and monitor for unusual login patterns.
- **Threat**: Man-in-the-middle attacks during authentication.
  - **Countermeasure**: Ensure all communication is encrypted using TLS.

By identifying these threats early, the team can incorporate these countermeasures into their design and guide their security testing efforts to ensure these threats are mitigated effectively.

## Threat Modeling Methodologies
- STRIDE
- DREAD
- PASTA
- LINDDUN
- OCTAVE

By using these methodologies, the development team can systematically identify and address security threats, ensuring the new authentication feature is robust and secure.
