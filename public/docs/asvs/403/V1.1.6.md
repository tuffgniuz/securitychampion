# Centralized, Simple, Vetted, and Reusable Security Controls

> Verify the implementation of centralized, simple, vetted, secure, and reusable security controls to avoid duplicate, missing, ineffective, or insecure controls.

## Objective
Ensure that security controls are designed to be simple, centralized, and reusable to avoid redundancy and reduce the risk of errors or omissions in security implementations.

## Rationale
Centralized controls ensure uniform application and easier maintenance across the application, reducing the risk of inconsistent security standards. Simple controls are more accessible and easier for developers to implement correctly, reducing errors. Vetted controls are reliable and adhere to industry best practices, providing confidence in their effectiveness. Reusable controls prevent redundancy and ensure consistency, making it easier to scale security measures as the application grows. By focusing on these principles, developers can build more secure and robust applications with less effort and fewer errors.
