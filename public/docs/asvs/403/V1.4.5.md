# Attribute or Feature-Based Access Control

> Verify that attribute or feature-based access control is used, where the code checks the user's authorization for a specific feature or data item rather than just their role. Permissions should still be allocated using roles.

## Objective
Ensure that access control decisions are made based on specific attributes or features, providing more granular and precise access control than role-based access control alone.

## Rationale
Attribute or feature-based access control (ABAC or FBAC) provides a finer level of control over what users can do within the system. Instead of relying solely on roles, which can be broad and sometimes insufficient, ABAC/FBAC evaluates specific attributes such as user properties, resource types, and environmental conditions to make access decisions. This approach allows for more nuanced and secure access policies. While roles are useful for initial permission assignments, checking attributes or specific features enhances security by ensuring users can only access what they are explicitly authorized to.

## Practical Example
In a document management system, a user might have the role of "Editor." However, using ABAC/FBAC, access control would also consider additional attributes such as:
- The document's classification level (e.g., public, confidential).
- The user's department.
- The user's current project assignments.
- The user's security clearance level.

For example:
- An editor with access to public documents might be denied access to confidential documents unless they have a higher security clearance.
- An editor working on Project A might not be allowed to edit documents related to Project B unless their project assignment includes both projects.

This granularity ensures that access control policies are more precisely tailored to real-world needs and security requirements.

By implementing attribute or feature-based access control, organizations can better secure their systems by ensuring that users have access only to the specific features and data they are authorized to use, beyond just their assigned roles.
