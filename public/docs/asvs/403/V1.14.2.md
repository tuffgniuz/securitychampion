# Secure Deployment of Binaries

> Verify that binary signatures, trusted connections, and verified endpoints are used to deploy binaries to remote devices.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that binaries deployed to remote devices are authentic and secure. This is achieved by using binary signatures, trusted connections, and verified endpoints to prevent tampering and unauthorized modifications during the deployment process.

## Rationale
Deploying binaries without proper security measures can lead to various risks, including the possibility of deploying malicious or tampered binaries. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of binaries is crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of the application and the systems it runs on.

## What you should do
1. **Use Binary Signatures**: Ensure that all binaries are signed using a cryptographic method. This allows the verification of the binary's origin and integrity before deployment.
2. **Establish Trusted Connections**: Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for transferring binaries to remote devices. This helps protect the binaries from being intercepted or altered during transit.
3. **Verify Endpoints**: Ensure that the endpoints involved in the deployment process are verified and trusted. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that binaries are only deployed to authorized devices.
