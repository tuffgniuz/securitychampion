# Expiration of Out-of-Band Authentication Requests

---

## Simplified Explanation

Out-of-band authentication requests, codes, or tokens should expire after 10 minutes to ensure they are not misused.

## Objective

To limit the timeframe in which out-of-band authentication mechanisms can be used, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Rationale

The expiration of out-of-band authentication mechanisms (like codes sent via SMS or email) is crucial for securing the authentication process. A short expiration time, such as 10 minutes, minimizes the window during which these codes can be intercepted or misused by an attacker. This practice ensures that even if an authentication token is compromised, its usefulness is time-bound and limited, significantly reducing the potential for unauthorized access.

## Implementation Tips

- Set a strict expiration time for authentication requests and tokens in the out-of-band mechanism.
- Ensure that the system automatically invalidates the authentication token or request after the expiration time has passed.
- Implement monitoring to detect and respond to repeated attempts to use expired tokens, which may indicate a potential attack.

This approach helps maintain the integrity of the authentication process, ensuring that out-of-band authentication remains a secure and reliable method for verifying user identity.
