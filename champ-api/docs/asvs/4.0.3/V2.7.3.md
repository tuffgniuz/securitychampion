# One-time Use for Out-of-Band Authentication Requests

---

## Simplified Explanation

Out-of-band authentication requests, codes, or tokens must be used only once and specifically for the intended authentication session.

## Objective

To ensure the integrity and security of the out-of-band authentication process by preventing the reuse of authentication tokens.

## Rationale

Single-use restrictions for out-of-band authentication tokens, such as codes sent via SMS or email, are crucial to prevent unauthorized access. Requiring that each token can be used only once and solely for the original authentication request prevents attackers from reusing or exploiting these tokens in replay attacks, significantly enhancing the security of the authentication process.

## Implementation Tips

- Ensure that each authentication token is tightly bound to a specific authentication session and invalidated immediately after use.
- Implement mechanisms to track the use of each token, preventing multiple uses and ensuring it is used in the correct context.
- Monitor and audit the usage of authentication tokens to detect and respond to any anomalies or suspicious activities.

By enforcing these controls, organizations can protect their out-of-band authentication mechanisms from being compromised and maintain the trustworthiness of their authentication processes.
