# Secure Storage and Protection Against Offline Recovery Attacks

---

## Simplified Explanation

Passwords must be stored securely to prevent them from being accessed or deciphered through offline attacks, including situations where an attacker has gained local system access.

## Objective

To protect stored passwords from being compromised and decrypted by attackers, ensuring their confidentiality and integrity, even if they gain direct access to the storage system.

## Rationale

The security of stored passwords is critical in safeguarding user accounts from unauthorized access. Proper protection involves implementing secure storage mechanisms that prevent attackers from retrieving or cracking passwords, especially in the event of an offline attack where the attacker has gained physical or local access to the storage system. This typically includes the use of strong encryption and hashing techniques that make password recovery computationally impractical.

## Implementation Tips

- Utilize strong, salted hashing algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 to store passwords, which are designed to be computationally intensive to crack.
- Ensure that hashed passwords are stored securely and are only accessible to authorized systems and personnel.
- Regularly audit and test the security of the password storage mechanism to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

By implementing these measures, organizations can enhance the security of their password storage and prevent unauthorized access through offline recovery attacks.
