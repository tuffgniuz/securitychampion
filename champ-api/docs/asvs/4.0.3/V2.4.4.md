# Appropriate Work Factor in Password Hashing

---

## Simplified Explanation

Implement password hashing with a work factor (number of iterations) that provides a balance between security and system performance.

## Objective

To ensure password hashing is secure enough to prevent brute-force attacks while still allowing for efficient system operation.

## Rationale

Using a hashing algorithm with a configurable work factor, like bcrypt, allows for adjusting the computational effort required to hash and verify passwords. This is crucial in deterring brute-force attacks by making each hash computation intentionally slow. However, itâ€™s important to balance this with the need for system performance, ensuring the hashing process does not overly tax system resources or degrade user experience.

## Implementation Tips

- Choose a work factor for bcrypt (or similar algorithms) that makes the hashing process slow enough to thwart attacks but still fast enough not to cause unacceptable delays in user authentication.
- Monitor and adjust the work factor as necessary, considering the evolving capabilities of hardware used by attackers and the performance of your own systems.
- Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen work factor in preventing brute-force attacks, adjusting as technology and attack methods evolve.

The implementation of a carefully chosen work factor in password hashing algorithms is a critical aspect of securing user passwords against brute-force attacks, balancing security needs with performance considerations.

## Terminology

**bcrypt**: A password hashing function designed for security by incorporating a salt and a cost factor (work factor) to slow down the hashing process, making brute-force attacks more difficult and time-consuming.
