## Enhanced Detail for ASVS V1.1.1

### Simplified Explanation
Ensure every phase of your project, from initial design to final deployment, includes security considerations. This means actively planning to protect your application against threats at every step of its development.

### Examples and Best Practices
- **Planning Phase**: Incorporate threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security issues from the start.
- **Design Phase**: Use secure design principles such as least privilege and defense in depth.
- **Implementation Phase**: Follow secure coding guidelines, such as those provided by OWASP, to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Verification Phase**: Implement automated security testing tools (SAST, DAST) to catch issues early.
- **Maintenance Phase**: Regularly update dependencies and patch known vulnerabilities.

### Tools and Resources
- **Threat Modeling**: Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon.
- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/).
- **Automated Testing Tools**: SonarQube (SAST), OWASP ZAP (DAST).

### Common Pitfalls
- Neglecting security considerations in early stages, leading to costly fixes later.
- Overlooking the importance of regular dependency updates and patches.

### Checklist for Compliance
- [ ] Conducted threat modeling during planning phase.
- [ ] Applied secure design principles.
- [ ] Followed secure coding guidelines.
- [ ] Performed automated security testing.
- [ ] Established a process for regular updates and patches.
