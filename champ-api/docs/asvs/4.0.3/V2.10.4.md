# Secure Management of Sensitive Information

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure secure handling of passwords, integration credentials, and secrets within source code and repositories, preventing exposure to offline attacks.

## Objective

To protect sensitive information like passwords and API keys from unauthorized access, particularly by ensuring they are not exposed in source code or version control repositories.

## Rationale

Sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and internal secrets, must be securely managed to prevent unauthorized access, especially in source code and version control repositories. Storing these credentials insecurely can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access and system compromise. Secure storage mechanisms, like software key stores, hardware TPMs, or HSMs, are recommended to safeguard these secrets.

## Implementation Tips

- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords and API keys directly in the source code.
- Use environment variables, encrypted configuration files, or secure secret management services to manage sensitive information.
- Implement access controls and audit logging to monitor access to sensitive information.
- Utilize secure hardware modules like TPM or HSM for storing and managing cryptographic keys and other sensitive information.

Adopting these practices ensures that sensitive information is managed securely, reducing the risk of exposure and enhancing the overall security posture of the application.
