# Notification of Credential Changes

---

## Simplified Explanation

Notify users through secure channels when changes are made to their credentials, such as password updates or modifications to account recovery settings.

## Objective

To inform users of any changes to their account credentials, allowing them to verify or contest unauthorized modifications promptly.

## Rationale

Timely notification of credential changes is essential for account security. It enables users to confirm that they initiated the changes or to quickly respond to unauthorized modifications, potentially stopping a security breach in its tracks. Notifications should be sent through secure channels to ensure they are received and recognized by the actual account holder, thereby preventing interception and misuse by attackers.

## Implementation Tips

- Send immediate notifications to users through multiple verified channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) when their account credentials are changed.
- Include details in the notification that can help users identify legitimate changes (e.g., timestamp, location of the request, nature of the change).
- Provide clear instructions in the notification for users to follow if they did not initiate the change, including how to secure their account and contact support.
- Ensure that the notification system itself is secure and resistant to tampering or spoofing.

By adhering to these practices, organizations can enhance the security and integrity of the account management process, ensuring users are promptly informed of and can react to changes in their account credentials.
