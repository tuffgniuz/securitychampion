# V2.2.7 - Verify Intent in Multi-factor Authentication

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms require explicit user action to confirm their intent to authenticate.

## Objective

To validate that the user not only possesses the authentication factor but also actively intends to use it for authentication, preventing misuse or accidental authentication.

## Rationale

Verifying the user's intent in MFA processes is essential to prevent unauthorized access that could occur if an authentication factor is lost, stolen, or manipulated. For example, a hardware token or mobile device could be used by someone other than the rightful owner if not properly safeguarded. Requiring a user-initiated action, like entering a PIN, pressing a button on a hardware token, or interacting with a mobile app notification, ensures that the person presenting the factor is doing so consciously and deliberately, thus legitimizing the authentication attempt.

## Implementation Tips

- For hardware MFA devices, ensure there is a physical action required, such as pressing a button, to activate the token.
- In mobile app-based MFA, require the user to interact with a notification or enter an in-app code to proceed with authentication.
- For SMS or email-based OTPs, instruct users to perform an additional step confirming they initiated the request.
- Implement behavioral analysis to detect patterns that may indicate automated or unintended authentication attempts.

Incorporating these measures adds a critical layer of security, confirming that the authentication attempt is intentional and authorized by the user, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the MFA system.
