# Check Passwords Against Breach Databases

---

## Simplified Explanation

Verify that passwords are not compromised by checking them against databases of known breached passwords.

## Objective

To prevent the use of passwords that have been exposed in past security breaches, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Rationale

Passwords previously exposed in breaches are often tried by attackers in credential stuffing or brute-force attacks, as they are commonly reused across different services. By ensuring that users' passwords have not been compromised and are not part of known breach databases, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture. This proactive measure prevents users from setting passwords that are already known to attackers, thus reducing the likelihood of successful account compromise.

## Implementation Tips

Use a service like Have I Been Pwned or a similar breach database API to check if the passwords are part of known breaches. Here's an example approach:

```plaintext
function isPasswordBreached(password: string): boolean {
  const hash = hashPassword(password);
  const prefix = hash.substring(0, 5);
  const suffix = hash.substring(5);
  const response = queryBreachDatabase(prefix);

  return response.contains(suffix);
}
```

In this pseudocode, `hashPassword` generates a hash of the password, which is then split into a prefix and suffix. The prefix is used to query a breach database, which returns a list of hashes that match the prefix. If the suffix is found in this list, the password is considered breached. This method allows checking passwords against breach lists without exposing the actual password.
