# V2.3.2 - Support User-provided Authenticators

## Simplified Explanation

Allow users to register and use their own authentication devices, such as U2F or FIDO tokens, for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Objective

To enhance security and user convenience by enabling the use of personal, trusted authentication devices in the MFA process.

## Rationale

Supporting user-provided authenticators, like U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) or FIDO (Fast Identity Online) tokens, empowers users to leverage advanced and familiar security devices for authentication. These devices often provide stronger security guarantees due to their resistance to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Allowing users to utilize their own devices can also increase their comfort and trust in the authentication process, as they can use tools they are familiar with and that are specifically designed for security.

## Implementation Tips

- Integrate with standards like FIDO2 to allow users to register and use their own security keys or biometric devices.
- Ensure the system's authentication framework can dynamically recognize and support various types of user-provided authenticators.
- Provide clear guidance and support to users on how to register and use their authentication devices with your system.
- Implement robust registration and de-registration processes for these devices to manage loss or theft scenarios effectively.

By accommodating user-provided authentication devices, organizations can offer a more flexible, secure, and user-friendly authentication experience.
