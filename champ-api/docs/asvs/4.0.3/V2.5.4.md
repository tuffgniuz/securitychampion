# Restrict Access to Password Reset Functionality

---

## Simplified Explanation

Limit the number of attempts and access to the password reset functionality to prevent abuse and potential security breaches.

## Objective

To secure the password reset process against brute force, enumeration, and other malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access.

## Rationale

The password reset function is a critical component of account security management. If improperly secured, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access through methods like brute force attacks or user enumeration. Implementing restrictions such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA verification, and requiring additional authentication factors can help mitigate these risks.

## Implementation Tips

- Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of password reset attempts from a single IP address or account within a given timeframe.
- Use CAPTCHA or similar challenges to distinguish between human users and automated scripts.
- Require additional verification steps, such as answering security questions or providing a code sent to a verified email address or phone number.
- Log and monitor password reset attempts to detect and respond to potential abuse or suspicious activities.

These measures help to protect the password reset process from being exploited, ensuring that only authorized users can successfully request and complete a password reset.
