# Secure Password Storage

---

## Simplified Explanation

Store passwords using secure methods that are resistant to offline attacks, employing strong hashing and salting techniques.

## Objective

To protect stored passwords from being compromised, especially in the event of a data breach, by making them difficult to decrypt.

## Rationale

Secure password storage is critical to safeguarding user credentials. In the event of a data breach, passwords stored in plain text or using weak encryption can be easily accessed and exploited by attackers. Using strong, one-way hashing algorithms with salts (random data added to the password before hashing) ensures that even if the data is compromised, the passwords remain protected against offline attacks. This method makes it computationally expensive and time-consuming to crack the hashes, thereby significantly increasing the security of stored user credentials.

## Implementation Tips

- Employ modern, robust hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 for password storage.
- Ensure that each password is salted with a unique, randomly generated salt before hashing.
- Store the salt and the hashed password together in the database, but ensure they are treated separately in the system's logic.
- Regularly review and update your password hashing and storage practices to comply with current security standards and recommendations.

Adopting these secure storage practices helps in protecting user passwords against unauthorized access and use, even if the storage system is compromised.
