# V2.4.2 - Use Sufficiently Long Salts in Password Hashing

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that salts used in password hashing are at least 32 bits in length and uniquely generated for each password.

## Objective

To enhance the security of hashed passwords by preventing attackers from using precomputed hash tables to crack them.

## Rationale

Salts are random values added to passwords before hashing to ensure that the resulting hash is unique, even for identical passwords. Using sufficiently long salts, unique for each password, makes it much harder for attackers to use rainbow tables (precomputed tables of hash values) or other precomputed attack methods to crack the hashes. Long, unique salts require attackers to compute hashes for each specific salted password, significantly increasing the time and resources needed to crack passwords, thereby enhancing the overall security of stored credentials.

## Implementation Tips

- Generate a unique salt for each password, ensuring it is random and at least 32 bits in length.
- Use cryptographic functions from reputable libraries to handle salt generation and password hashing.
- Combine the password and salt in a secure manner before applying the hashing algorithm.
- Store the salt separately from the hashed password in the database to add an additional layer of complexity for attackers.

Implementing these practices significantly improves the resilience of stored passwords against offline cracking attempts, safeguarding user data effectively.
