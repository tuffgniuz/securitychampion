# Hashed Storage of Authentication Codes

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that only a hashed version of the authentication code is retained by the out-of-band verifier.

## Objective

To protect the integrity and confidentiality of authentication codes used in the out-of-band verification process by storing them in a hashed format.

## Rationale

Storing authentication codes in plaintext can pose a significant security risk if the storage system is compromised. Hashing these codes ensures that they cannot be directly used by an attacker even if they gain access to the storage system. This practice aligns with the principle of storing sensitive information in a secure manner, similar to how passwords should be stored using cryptographic hashes.

## Implementation Tips

- Use a strong, cryptographic hashing function to hash authentication codes before storage.
- Ensure that the hash function includes a salt to prevent the use of precomputed hash tables in attempts to reverse the hash.
- Regularly audit the storage and handling of authentication codes to ensure compliance with security best practices.

By implementing these measures, organizations can enhance the security of their out-of-band authentication mechanisms, ensuring that authentication codes are protected against unauthorized access and misuse.
