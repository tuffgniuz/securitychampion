# V2.1.1 - Secure Password Length

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that passwords created by users are at least 12 characters long, considering that multiple consecutive spaces are treated as a single space.

## Objective

To strengthen password security by enforcing a minimum length, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks.

## Rationale

Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack, providing a foundational layer of security against unauthorized access. This requirement aims to mitigate the risk of brute-force attacks, where attackers systematically check all possible passwords. By setting a minimum password length, the possible combinations increase significantly, enhancing the security of user accounts.

## Implementation Tips

When implementing this security measure, follow these pseudocode steps:

```plaintext
function isPasswordValid(password: string): boolean {
  // Combine consecutive spaces into one
  const normalizedPassword = password.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
  
  // Check if the password length meets the minimum requirement
  if (normalizedPassword.length >= 12) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
