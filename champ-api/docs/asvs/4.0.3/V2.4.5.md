# Additional Iteration and Secret Salting in Password Hashing

---

## Simplified Explanation

Enhance password hashing with an extra layer of security by using a secret salt and additional iterations in the key derivation process.

## Objective

To fortify the protection of stored passwords against offline attacks by making the hashing process more complex and less predictable.

## Rationale

Secret salting, unlike regular salting, involves using a secret value in the hashing process that is not stored with the password hash, adding an extra layer of security. This secret is typically managed separately, often in a secure environment like a hardware security module (HSM). By combining this secret salt with additional iterations in the hashing process, the complexity and security of the generated password hash are significantly increased, making it much harder for attackers to crack the password even if they gain access to the stored hashes.

## Implementation Tips

- Use a secret value in addition to the user-specific salt when hashing passwords, and ensure this secret is stored securely, separate from the database where password hashes are kept.
- Increase the iteration count in the password hashing process to enhance the computational effort required to generate each hash.
- Consider the use of secure environments like HSMs to manage secret values and perform cryptographic operations, providing an added level of security against unauthorized access and tampering.

The combination of secret salting and increased iterations in password hashing serves to significantly heighten the security of stored password hashes, effectively countering attempts at offline cracking and reinforcing the overall security posture of the authentication system.
