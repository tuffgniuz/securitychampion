# Ensure Comprehensive Password Validation

---

## Simplified Explanation

Validate passwords to ensure they meet predefined security criteria, without being overly simplistic or common.

## Objective

To enhance the security of passwords by ensuring they are complex and unique, thus harder to guess or crack.

## Rationale

Comprehensive password validation is crucial for protecting user accounts from unauthorized access. By enforcing a policy that passwords must meet specific security criteria, organizations can reduce the risk of successful brute-force or dictionary attacks. This requirement aims to eliminate common, easily guessable passwords and encourage users to create more secure, complex passwords. It's essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user data, and for safeguarding the overall security posture of the system.

## Implementation Tips

Implement password validation that checks against common password pitfalls, such as using widely known passwords, patterns, or simplistic sequences. For example:

```plaintext
function isPasswordComplex(password: string): boolean {
  const passwordBlacklist = ['password123', '12345678', 'qwerty'];
  const regexPattern = /(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-zA-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])/;
  
  return !passwordBlacklist.includes(password) && regexPattern.test(password);
}
```

This pseudocode ensures that the password is not in a list of common passwords and meets basic complexity requirements, including the presence of numbers, letters, and special characters.
