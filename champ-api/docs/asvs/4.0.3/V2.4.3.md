# V2.4.3 - Password Hashing with Adequate Iterations

## Simplified Explanation

Use a password hashing method that includes a significant number of iterations to slow down hash computation, enhancing security against brute-force attacks.

## Objective

To increase the time and computational cost required to crack passwords, thereby enhancing the security of stored password hashes.

## Rationale

Applying a significant number of iterations in the password hashing process (e.g., using key derivation functions like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2) makes it computationally expensive to crack passwords. This is particularly effective against brute-force attacks, where attackers attempt to guess the password by trying many combinations quickly. Increasing the number of hashing iterations exponentially increases the time and resources required to crack each password, providing a robust defense against unauthorized access attempts.

## Implementation Tips

- Use a password hashing algorithm designed for secure password storage, like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2, which supports configurable iterations (or "work factor").
- Set the number of iterations to a value high enough to significantly delay password cracking attempts but balanced with system performance requirements.
- Regularly review and update the iteration count to adjust for advances in computational power and threat landscapes.

By implementing these practices, the security of password storage can be significantly improved, reducing the risk of successful password cracking and enhancing the overall protection of user data.
