# Secure Notifications for Authentication Changes

---

## Simplified Explanation

Send secure notifications to users following significant changes to their authentication settings, like password resets or changes in contact information.

## Objective

To promptly inform users of changes to their authentication details, allowing them to react swiftly to potential unauthorized actions.

## Rationale

Notifying users of changes to their authentication settings, such as password resets or updates to their registered email or phone number, is a crucial security measure. These notifications can act as an early warning system for users if the changes were not initiated by them, potentially indicating a security breach. Secure notification methods, like push notifications through verified apps, are preferred over SMS or email, which could be intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. This approach helps to ensure that users are immediately aware of and can respond to any unauthorized modifications to their account security settings.

## Implementation Tips

- Implement a notification system that uses a secure and direct communication channel with the user.
- Ensure notifications contain sufficient details for users to understand the nature and significance of the change.
- Provide instructions or direct links in the notifications for users to take immediate action if they did not initiate the change.
