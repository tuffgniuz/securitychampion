# V2.1.2 - Support and Restrict Password Length

## Simplified Explanation

Allow users to create passwords that are up to 64 characters long, but not longer than 128 characters.

## Objective

To ensure password strength and system efficiency by defining appropriate minimum and maximum password lengths.

## Rationale

The rationale behind setting a specific range for password length is to enhance security while maintaining system usability and performance. Allowing passwords of up to 64 characters enables users to create complex and secure passphrases, which are more resistant to brute-force attacks compared to shorter passwords. At the same time, limiting the maximum length to 128 characters helps prevent issues related to data storage and processing. Excessively long passwords can lead to increased storage requirements and longer processing times, potentially impacting system performance and user experience. Moreover, imposing a maximum length can mitigate the risk of buffer overflow attacks, where attackers exploit input fields to execute arbitrary code on the server. By defining a thoughtful range for password lengths, organizations can balance between securing user accounts and ensuring efficient system operation.

## Implementation Tips

Ensure the password policy enforcement mechanism in your system checks both the minimum and maximum length requirements:

```plaintext
function isPasswordLengthValid(password: string): boolean {
  const minLength = 12;
  const maxLength = 128;
  
  return password.length >= minLength && password.length <= maxLength;
}
```

This pseudocode illustrates how to validate password lengths, ensuring they meet security standards while avoiding system strain.
