# Single-Use Lookup Secrets

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that lookup secrets, used in processes like password recovery, are designed to be used only once.

## Objective

To prevent the misuse of lookup secrets by ensuring they cannot be reused in unauthorized attempts to gain access.

## Rationale

Lookup secrets, such as codes or tokens sent to users for account verification or password reset, should be single-use to enhance security. This prevents potential attackers from reusing these secrets in replay attacks to gain unauthorized access. Single-use tokens ensure that once a secret is used for verification, it becomes invalid, thereby protecting the account from fraudulent access attempts.

## Implementation Tips

- Generate unique lookup secrets for each authentication or recovery request.
- Invalidate the secret immediately after use, ensuring it cannot be reused.
- Monitor the usage of lookup secrets to detect and respond to any unusual or unauthorized attempts to use them.
- Implement additional security measures, such as expiry time limits and rate limiting, to further protect against abuse of lookup secrets.

By adhering to these practices, organizations can secure the processes that rely on lookup secrets, thereby mitigating the risk of replay attacks and unauthorized access to user accounts.
