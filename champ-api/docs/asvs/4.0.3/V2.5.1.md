# Secure Initial Activation or Recovery Secrets

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that any initial activation or recovery secrets are not transmitted in clear text and are protected through secure methods.

## Objective

To maintain the confidentiality and integrity of initial activation or recovery secrets, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure account setup or recovery.

## Rationale

The initial activation or recovery secrets, such as temporary passwords or reset codes, are critical to the security of the user account setup and recovery processes. Transmitting these secrets in clear text can expose them to interception by attackers, leading to unauthorized account access. Secure transmission and handling of these secrets are essential to prevent such vulnerabilities and ensure that only the intended user can use these secrets to activate or recover their account.
