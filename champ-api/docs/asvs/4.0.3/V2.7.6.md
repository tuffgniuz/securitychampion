# Secure Random Number Generation for Authentication Codes

---

## Simplified Explanation

Authentication codes must be generated using a secure random number generator, containing at least 20 bits of entropy to ensure sufficient randomness and security.

## Objective

To ensure that authentication codes are secure and resistant to prediction or brute-force attacks.

## Rationale

The use of a secure random number generator with at least 20 bits of entropy for generating authentication codes is crucial to prevent attackers from being able to predict or guess these codes. A six-digit random number is typically considered to provide sufficient entropy, ensuring the codes are secure and robust against unauthorized access attempts.

## Implementation Tips

- Utilize cryptographic libraries or built-in functions in your development platform that provide secure random number generation capabilities.
- Ensure that each authentication code is unique and unpredictable by using adequate entropy in the generation process.
- Regularly evaluate the entropy requirement and adjust it based on the evolving security landscape and threat analysis.

By following these guidelines, authentication codes can be made secure against prediction and brute-force attacks, enhancing the overall security of the authentication process【164:3†source】.
