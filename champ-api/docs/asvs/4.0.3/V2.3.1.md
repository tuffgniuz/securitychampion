# V2.3.1 - Secure Initial Passwords and Activation Codes

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that initial passwords or activation codes generated by the system are secure, have an expiration time, and are replaced upon first use.

## Objective

To safeguard the initial step in the user's interaction with the system, ensuring that the initial credentials are secure and temporary.

## Rationale

The first set of credentials, like initial passwords or activation codes, given to a new user, should be created with security in mind to prevent unauthorized access. These credentials should be randomly generated, complex enough to resist guessing or brute-force attacks, and have a limited validity period to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker. Additionally, these initial credentials should be replaced with a user-defined password or code at the first login to ensure the ongoing security of the account.

## Implementation Tips

- Generate initial passwords or activation codes using a secure randomization process to ensure they are unique and unpredictable.
- Set an expiration time for these credentials, prompting users to change them shortly after issuance.
- Enforce a policy that requires the user to replace the initial credentials with their own password or code during the first login.
- Educate users on the importance of creating strong, unique passwords when replacing the initial credentials.

By following these guidelines, organizations can secure the process of onboarding new users and establishing their initial authentication credentials, reducing the risk of unauthorized access from the outset.
