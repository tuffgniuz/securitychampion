# V2.2.1 - Effective Anti-Automation for Authentication

## Simplified Explanation

Implement controls to protect against automated attacks like brute force, credential stuffing, and account lockout.

## Objective

To safeguard the authentication process from automated attacks that attempt to guess or use stolen credentials.

## Rationale

Automated attacks on authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and account compromise. Effective anti-automation controls, such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA, account lockout mechanisms, and monitoring for unusual login attempts, are crucial in defending against these attacks. These measures help to distinguish between legitimate user activities and automated attack patterns, reducing the risk of successful attacks and enhancing the overall security of the system.

## Implementation Tips

Utilize a combination of strategies to mitigate automated attacks:
- Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address or account within a certain timeframe.
- Use CAPTCHA challenges to differentiate between humans and automated scripts.
- Employ account lockout policies that temporarily disable an account after several failed login attempts, while ensuring legitimate users can recover their access.
- Monitor and analyze login attempts to detect and respond to potential automated attacks promptly.
