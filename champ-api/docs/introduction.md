# Introduction

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a comprehensive framework designed for security professionals, software developers, and auditors to establish a baseline for secure development and deployment of web applications. Tailored to meet the needs of organizations seeking to enhance their application security posture, ASVS serves as a guide for developing, maintaining, and testing secure software. It offers a clear and structured set of security requirements and controls that span various aspects of application security, including authentication, session management, access control, and secure coding practices. By adhering to the standards outlined in ASVS, organizations can significantly reduce vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with security best practices, and protect sensitive data from potential threats.

## Understanding ASVS

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is not just a comprehensive framework; it's a blueprint for secure application development, maintenance, and testing. At its core, ASVS categorizes its security requirements into 14 distinct categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of application security. These categories are designed to cover the breadth of security considerations necessary for robust application development. They include, but are not limited to, Authentication, Session Management, Access Control, Data Validation, Cryptography, Error Handling, Data Protection, and Secure Coding Practices. Within each category, the requirements are further divided into subcategories, providing a granular approach to addressing specific security concerns.

## Solomon

Solomon is build to demystify and streamline the application of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) within software development projects. Its primary mission is to serve as a centralized repository and management tool for ASVS requirements, enabling developers and security professionals to efficiently search, filter, and apply security guidelines directly to their projects. By facilitating the attachment of specific ASVS requirements to development issues, Solomon enhances the visibility and integration of security considerations throughout the development lifecycle. Moreover, it bridges the gap between theory and practice by linking to OWASP Cheat Sheets for deeper insights and providing bite-sized explanations for each requirement. These features not only make Solomon an invaluable asset for enforcing security best practices but also foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement in application security.
