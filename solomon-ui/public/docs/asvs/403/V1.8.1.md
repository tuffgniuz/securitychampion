*V1.8 Data Protection and Privacy Architecture*

# Identification and Classification of Sensitive Data

> Verify that all sensitive data is identified and classified into protection levels.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all sensitive data handled by the application is properly identified and classified according to its sensitivity. This classification helps determine the appropriate security measures needed to protect each type of data.

## Rationale
Identifying and classifying sensitive data helps to:
- **Ensure proper protection**: Different types of data require different levels of protection based on their sensitivity.
- **Facilitate compliance**: Helps meet legal and regulatory requirements for data protection.
- **Enhance data management**: Enables better data governance by providing a clear understanding of what data needs protection and how it should be handled.
- **Improve security measures**: Tailors security controls to the specific needs of each type of sensitive data, ensuring that the most critical data receives the highest level of protection.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Data Breaches**: Unclassified or poorly classified data may not receive adequate protection, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Non-Compliance**: Failure to identify and classify sensitive data can result in non-compliance with data protection regulations, leading to fines and reputational damage.
- **Improper Handling**: Without clear classification, sensitive data might be mishandled or inadequately protected, increasing the risk of exposure.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Conduct a data inventory to identify all sensitive data handled by the application.
- Classify data into different protection levels based on criteria such as sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and business impact.
- Implement appropriate security controls for each classification level, such as encryption for highly sensitive data, access controls, and audit logging.

For example, a healthcare application might classify patient medical records as highly sensitive data requiring encryption both in transit and at rest, while general user profile information might be classified as less sensitive but still protected by access controls and monitoring.

By identifying and classifying all sensitive data, organizations can ensure that each type of data is adequately protected according to its specific needs, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.
