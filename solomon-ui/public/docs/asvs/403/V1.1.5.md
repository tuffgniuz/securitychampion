# High-Level Architecture Security Analysis

> Verify definition and security analysis of the application's high-level architecture and all connected remote services.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that the application's overall architecture is designed with security in mind. This involves defining and analyzing the security of all components and services that make up the application, including those that interact with remote services.

## Rationale
Conducting a high-level architecture security analysis helps organizations:
- Identify and address security risks associated with the interaction between different components and remote services.
- Ensure that security controls are implemented consistently across the application.
- Detect potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- Provide a clear understanding of the security posture of the entire application, facilitating better risk management and decision-making.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Create detailed diagrams that outline the application's architecture, including all components, data flows, and interactions with remote services.
- Conduct regular security reviews of the architecture to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- Implement security controls such as encryption, authentication, and access control to protect data and services.
- Ensure that remote services are evaluated for their security posture and integrated securely with the application.

For instance, if the application uses a third-party payment gateway, the architecture security analysis should ensure that:
- The communication between the application and the payment gateway is encrypted.
- Proper authentication mechanisms are in place to verify the identity of the payment gateway.
- Access controls are implemented to restrict access to sensitive payment information.

By performing these analyses, organizations can enhance the security of their applications and reduce the risk of security breaches.
