*V1.4 Access Control Architecture*

# Feature-Based Access Control

> Verify that attribute or feature-based access control is used whereby the code checks the user's authorization for a feature/data item rather than just their role. Permissions should still be allocated using roles.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that access control is fine-grained and checks are based on specific attributes or features that a user is authorized to access. This goes beyond simple role-based access control (RBAC) by considering additional attributes and conditions for making access decisions.

## Rationale
Implementing attribute or feature-based access control helps to:
- **Provide fine-grained access control**: Allows for more specific and detailed access decisions based on user attributes and the context of the access request.
- **Enhance security**: Reduces the risk of over-privileged roles by ensuring that users have access only to what they need.
- **Improve flexibility**: Supports complex access control requirements that cannot be easily managed through roles alone.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Role Explosion**: Relying solely on roles can lead to role explosion, where too many roles are created to handle all possible access scenarios, making management difficult and error-prone.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Inadequate checks on user attributes can lead to privilege escalation, where users gain access to resources they should not have.
- **Bypass Attacks**: Without fine-grained controls, attackers might exploit broad role-based permissions to access sensitive data or features.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) that evaluates user attributes (e.g., department, job function) and context (e.g., time of day, location) in addition to roles.
- Use a policy engine to define and enforce access control rules based on these attributes.
- Ensure that permissions are still assigned using roles but are refined with additional checks based on attributes.

For example, a healthcare application might grant access to patient records based not only on the role (e.g., doctor, nurse) but also on the specific department and the patient's treatment status. A doctor in the cardiology department might have access to cardiology patient records, but not to records from other departments unless explicitly authorized.

By implementing attribute or feature-based access control, organizations can achieve more precise and secure access control, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing overall security.
