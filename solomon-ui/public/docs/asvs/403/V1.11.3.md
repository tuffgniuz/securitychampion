**Requirement V1.11.3**

*V1.11 Business Logic Architecture*

# Thread Safety in High-Value Business Logic Flows

> Verify that all high-value business logic flows, including authentication, session management, and access control, are thread-safe and resistant to time-of-check and time-of-use race conditions.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that high-value business logic flows are implemented in a thread-safe manner and are resistant to race conditions. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of operations that are essential to the application's functionality.

## Rationale
Ensuring thread safety and resistance to race conditions helps to:
- **Prevent Data Inconsistencies**: Thread safety ensures that data is correctly handled in concurrent execution environments, avoiding inconsistencies.
- **Maintain Security**: Protecting against time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions prevents attackers from exploiting timing windows to manipulate data or perform unauthorized actions.
- **Enhance Reliability**: Thread-safe code and protection against race conditions contribute to the overall reliability and stability of the application.
- **Ensure Correct Operation**: Critical business logic flows, such as authentication and access control, must operate correctly even under concurrent access to prevent unauthorized actions and ensure accurate processing.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Use synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, to ensure that only one thread can execute critical sections of the code at a time.
- Implement atomic operations to ensure that complex updates to shared data are performed as indivisible actions.
- Use thread-safe data structures that are designed to handle concurrent access.
- Regularly review and test code for potential race conditions and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place.

By implementing thread safety and resistance to TOCTOU race conditions in high-value business logic flows, organizations can ensure the integrity, security, and reliability of their critical operations.
