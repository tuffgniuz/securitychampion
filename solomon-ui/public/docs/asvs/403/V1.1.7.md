*V1.1 Secure Software Development Lifecycle*

# Secure Coding Checklist

> Verify availability of a secure coding checklist, security requirements, guideline, or policy to all developers and testers.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all team members have access to standardized and vetted security practices. This helps in maintaining a consistent security posture across the development lifecycle by providing clear and actionable guidelines.

## Rationale
By having a secure coding checklist and guidelines available to all developers and testers, organizations can:
- Promote uniformity in how security is implemented across different projects.
- Reduce the likelihood of security oversights by providing a reference for common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
- Enhance the overall security awareness among team members, leading to more secure application development.

## Practical Example
An organization might develop a secure coding checklist that includes items such as:
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries for database access.
- Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- Implement proper error handling and logging without exposing sensitive information.
- Regularly update and patch third-party libraries and dependencies.

These checklists and guidelines should be easily accessible, regularly updated, and incorporated into the daily workflow of developers and testers. This can be achieved by integrating them into code review processes, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and during sprint planning sessions.
