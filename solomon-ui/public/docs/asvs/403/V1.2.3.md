*V1.2 Authentication Architecture*

# Service Authentication

> Verify that service accounts for components and services do not share credentials. Each service should have a distinct set of credentials.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that each service and component within an application has unique credentials. This practice helps isolate services, preventing a compromise in one area from affecting others.

## Rationale
Using unique credentials for each service and component helps to:
- Limit the scope of damage if credentials are compromised.
- Prevent lateral movement within the network by attackers.
- Facilitate auditing and tracking of service access and actions.
- Enhance overall security by ensuring that each service has its own secure access credentials.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Ensure that each microservice in an application has a unique username and password.
- Use a secrets management system to securely store and manage these credentials.
- Regularly rotate and audit the credentials for each service to ensure they remain secure.
- Implement automated mechanisms to update credentials across services and components without manual intervention.

For instance, if an application has multiple microservices interacting with a central database, each microservice should have its own database credentials. These credentials should be stored securely using a secrets management tool, and access should be granted based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that each microservice can only access the data it needs.

By implementing these practices, organizations can enhance the security of their authentication architecture, making it more robust and resilient to attacks.
