*V2.1 Password Security*

# Password Change Functionality

> Verify that password change functionality requires the user's current and new password.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that only the legitimate account holder can change their password. By requiring the user to input their current password along with the new one, you provide an additional layer of security against unauthorized password changes.

## Rationale
Requiring the current password for a password change helps to:
- **Verify Identity**: Confirms that the person requesting the change is indeed the account holder.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Changes**: Deters attackers who may have gained temporary access to a userâ€™s session from changing the password without knowing the current password.
- **Enhance Security**: Adds an extra step to protect against automated attacks and ensures that the user is aware of the change being made.

## What You Should Do
1. **Require Current Password**: Implement a mechanism that mandates the input of the current password along with the new password during the password change process.
2. **Secure the Process**: Ensure that the password change process is conducted over a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS) to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **Notify Users**: Send notifications to users when their passwords are changed to alert them to any unauthorized changes.

## Summary
By requiring users to provide their current password when changing to a new one, you significantly enhance the security of the password change process. This measure helps verify the identity of the user and prevents unauthorized changes, thereby protecting user accounts from potential attacks.
