*V1.9 Communications Architecture*

# Authenticating Communication Links

> Verify that application components verify the authenticity of each side in a communication link to prevent person-in-the-middle attacks. For example, application components should validate TLS certificates and chains.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all communication links between application components are authenticated. This means that each component must verify the identity of the other component it is communicating with, preventing person-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring secure communications.

## Rationale
Authenticating communication links helps to:
- **Prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: By ensuring that both sides of the communication link are authenticated, the risk of MitM attacks is significantly reduced.
- **Ensure Data Integrity and Confidentiality**: Validating TLS certificates and chains ensures that the data being transmitted is not tampered with and is kept confidential.
- **Establish Trust**: Authentication establishes a trust relationship between communicating components, ensuring that data is exchanged with legitimate entities.
- **Comply with Security Standards**: Meeting this requirement aligns with best practices and security standards for secure communication.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and alter communications if the authenticity of communication links is not verified.
- **Spoofing**: An attacker can impersonate a legitimate component if TLS certificates and chains are not validated, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Data Tampering**: Without proper authentication, data integrity can be compromised, leading to incorrect or malicious data being processed by the application.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement TLS with mutual authentication, where both the client and server present and validate certificates.
- Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage and validate certificates and their chains.
- Ensure that all communication between microservices or components in a distributed system uses TLS and that certificates are properly validated before establishing a connection.
- Regularly update and audit TLS configurations and certificates to ensure they are not expired or compromised.

For example, in a microservices architecture, each service might be configured to present a TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Each service also validates the certificate of the other service it communicates with to ensure it is talking to a trusted entity.

By ensuring that communication links are authenticated, organizations can protect against MitM attacks, ensure data integrity and confidentiality, and establish a trusted communication environment for their applications.
