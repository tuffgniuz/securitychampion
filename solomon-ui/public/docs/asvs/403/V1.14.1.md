# Segregation of Components

> Verify the segregation of components of differing trust levels through well-defined security controls, firewall rules, API gateways, reverse proxies, cloud-based security groups, or similar mechanisms.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that components with different levels of trust are properly segregated using various security mechanisms. This segregation helps protect sensitive components from being compromised by less trusted ones.

## Rationale
Components with different trust levels often have varying security requirements. By segregating them, you minimize the risk of a security breach in a less trusted component affecting more sensitive parts of the system. This approach reduces the overall attack surface and enhances the security posture of your application.

## What you should do
1. **Implement Security Controls**: Use security controls such as firewalls, API gateways, and reverse proxies to segregate different components.
2. **Define Firewall Rules**: Set up firewall rules to control and restrict traffic between components based on their trust levels.
3. **Use Cloud Security Groups**: In cloud environments, leverage security groups to isolate and control access to components with differing trust levels.
4. **Regularly Audit and Update Configurations**: Continuously monitor and update your security configurations to adapt to new threats and changes in your architecture.

### Example
- Use a firewall to restrict access to your database server, allowing only your application servers to communicate with it.
- Deploy an API gateway to control and monitor traffic between microservices, ensuring that only authorized services can interact with sensitive endpoints.

This approach ensures that components with varying security requirements are effectively isolated, reducing the risk of a compromise spreading across your system.
