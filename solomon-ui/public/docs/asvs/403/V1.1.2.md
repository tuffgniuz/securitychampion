*V1.1 Secure Software Development Lifecycle*

# Threat Modeling

> Verify the use of threat modeling for every design change or sprint planning to identify threats, plan for countermeasures, facilitate appropriate risk responses, and guide security testing.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that potential security threats are identified and addressed during the design and planning phases of development. This proactive approach helps teams anticipate and mitigate risks before they can be exploited in production.

## Rationale
By incorporating threat modeling into the development lifecycle, organizations can:
- Identify vulnerabilities early in the design phase, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.
- Enhance the understanding of potential attack vectors and how they can be mitigated.
- Ensure that security is considered an integral part of the design and development process.
- Facilitate better communication among team members regarding security concerns and solutions.

## Practical Example
A development team might conduct a threat modeling session at the beginning of a sprint. They would:
- Create data flow diagrams to map out how data moves through the system.
- Identify trust boundaries where data moves between different security domains.
- Brainstorm potential threats, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and document them.
- Plan countermeasures, such as input validation and output encoding, to mitigate identified threats.
- Use the findings to guide the security testing efforts, ensuring that specific threats are tested for during quality assurance.

This process helps ensure that security considerations are embedded into the development process, leading to more robust and secure applications.
