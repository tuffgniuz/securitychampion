*V1.5 Input and Output Architecture*

# Trusted Service Layer Input Validation

> Verify that input validation is enforced on a trusted service layer.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that all input validation occurs on a secure and trusted layer of the application architecture. This prevents attackers from bypassing client-side validation and ensures that all data entering the system is properly validated.

## Rationale
Enforcing input validation on a trusted service layer helps to:
- **Prevent bypasses**: Client-side validation can be easily bypassed by attackers, so server-side validation ensures that all inputs are properly checked.
- **Ensure data integrity**: Validating inputs on the server ensures that only correctly formatted and expected data is processed, reducing the risk of errors and attacks.
- **Centralize security**: Centralizing input validation simplifies maintenance and auditing, ensuring consistent security practices across the application.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Client-Side Bypass**: Attackers can disable or manipulate client-side validation using browser tools or custom scripts, injecting malicious inputs into the system.
- **Injection Attacks**: Without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., SQL, XSS, or command injection) into the application.
- **Data Tampering**: Invalid or unexpected inputs can cause the application to behave unpredictably, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and data corruption.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Implement input validation checks on the server side using a validation framework or library.
- Define and enforce validation rules for different types of inputs, such as ensuring email addresses follow the correct format or numbers are within an expected range.
- Reject any input that does not meet the defined criteria, logging such attempts for further investigation.

For example, if a user submits a form with their email address, the server should validate that the email address is in the correct format before processing it. Even if the client-side validation is bypassed, the server-side validation ensures that only valid email addresses are accepted.

By enforcing input validation on a trusted service layer, organizations can protect their applications from a wide range of attacks and ensure the integrity and security of the data they process.
