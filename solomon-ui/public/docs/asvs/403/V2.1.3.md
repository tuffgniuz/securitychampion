*V2.1 Password Security*

# Avoid Password Truncation

> Verify that password truncation is not performed. However, consecutive multiple spaces may be replaced by a single space.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that passwords are stored and processed in their entirety without truncation. This helps maintain the integrity and strength of user passwords.

## Rationale
Truncating passwords can significantly reduce their strength and effectiveness, making them more vulnerable to attacks. By ensuring that passwords are not truncated, you preserve their intended complexity and security benefits. Allowing multiple consecutive spaces to be replaced by a single space helps standardize password length without compromising security.

## What You Should Do
1. **Avoid Truncation**: Ensure that your application does not truncate passwords at any point during storage, processing, or validation.
2. **Normalize Spaces**: Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space to standardize password lengths and prevent trivial length padding.

## Summary
By avoiding password truncation and appropriately handling spaces, you ensure the integrity and security of user passwords. This approach helps maintain strong, complex passwords, enhancing the overall security of your application.
