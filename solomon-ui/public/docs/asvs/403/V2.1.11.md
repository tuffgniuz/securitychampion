*V2.1 Password Security*

# Allow Paste Functionality and External Password Managers

> Verify that "paste" functionality, browser password helpers, and external password managers are permitted.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to improve user experience and security by allowing the use of external tools that can assist in managing and entering passwords.

## Rationale
Allowing users to paste passwords and use password managers offers several benefits:
- **User Convenience**: Users can easily manage and input complex passwords without memorizing them.
- **Increased Security**: Password managers can generate and store strong, unique passwords, reducing the likelihood of password reuse and weak passwords.
- **Error Reduction**: Permitting paste functionality reduces the chances of typographical errors when entering passwords.

## What You Should Do
1. **Allow Paste Functionality**: Ensure your application does not block the ability to paste passwords into password fields.
2. **Support Password Managers**: Design your application to be compatible with browser password helpers and external password managers.
3. **Educate Users**: Encourage users to utilize password managers for creating and storing strong, unique passwords.

## Summary
By allowing paste functionality and supporting external password managers, you enhance both the security and usability of your application. This approach encourages the use of strong passwords and simplifies the user authentication process.
