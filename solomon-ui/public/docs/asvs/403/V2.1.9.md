*V2.1 Password Security*

# No Password Composition Rules

> Verify that there are no password composition rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There should be no requirement for upper or lower case or numbers or special characters.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to allow users the flexibility to create passwords using any characters they choose without being restricted by specific composition rules. This promotes the creation of passwords that are both secure and memorable for users.

## Rationale
Imposing strict composition rules on passwords can often lead to predictable patterns, making them easier for attackers to guess. By allowing users to use any combination of characters, including upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters without specific requirements, users can create more unique and potentially more secure passwords. Additionally, this flexibility helps accommodate a broader range of user preferences and practices.

## What You Should Do
1. **Remove Composition Rules**: Ensure your application does not enforce specific character requirements, such as mandatory upper case letters, numbers, or special characters.
2. **Educate Users**: Provide guidance and encourage users to create strong passwords by mixing different types of characters without enforcing strict rules.
3. **Implement Password Strength Meter**: Use a password strength meter to help users understand the strength of their passwords and make informed choices.

### Summary
By avoiding specific password composition rules, you allow users to create passwords that are both secure and easy for them to remember. This approach helps prevent predictable patterns and encourages the use of a wider variety of characters, enhancing overall password security【109:0†source】.
