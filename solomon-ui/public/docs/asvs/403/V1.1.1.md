*V1.1 Secure Software Development Lifecycle*

# Secure Software Development Lifecycle Integration

> Verify the use of a secure software development lifecycle that addresses security in all stages of development.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to integrate security practices into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This ensures that security considerations are embedded from the initial design to deployment and maintenance, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and improving the overall security posture of the application.

## Rationale
Incorporating security into the SDLC helps organizations:
- Identify and mitigate security risks early in the development process.
- Ensure consistent application of security best practices.
- Enhance collaboration between development and security teams.
- Reduce the cost and effort associated with fixing security issues by addressing them early.

## Practical Example
An organization might implement the following practices to meet this requirement:
- **Planning**: Define security requirements and integrate them into user stories.
- **Design**: Conduct security reviews and threat modeling sessions to identify potential risks.
- **Implementation**: Follow secure coding guidelines and use automated tools to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**: Perform static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and code reviews focused on security.
- **Deployment**: Use secure deployment practices, such as automated security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update and patch systems, conduct security assessments, and monitor for new threats.

By embedding security throughout the SDLC, teams can create more resilient applications and reduce the likelihood of security breaches.
