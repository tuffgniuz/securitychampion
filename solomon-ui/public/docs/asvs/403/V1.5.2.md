# Serialization Integrity Controls

> Verify that serialization is not used when communicating with untrusted clients. If this is not possible, ensure that adequate integrity controls (and possibly encryption if sensitive data is sent) are enforced to prevent deserialization attacks including object injection.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to avoid the use of serialization when communicating with untrusted clients. If serialization is necessary, it should be protected with integrity controls and encryption to prevent deserialization attacks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or data tampering.

## Rationale
Preventing deserialization attacks is crucial because:
- **Deserialization attacks**: Malicious data can be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process, leading to remote code execution.
- **Data integrity**: Without integrity controls, serialized data can be tampered with, compromising the integrity and security of the application.
- **Sensitive data protection**: Encrypting serialized data ensures that sensitive information is protected during transmission.

### Attack Vectors:
- **Object Injection**: Attackers can manipulate serialized data to inject malicious objects into the application, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Tampering**: Without integrity checks, attackers can alter serialized data to manipulate application behavior or gain unauthorized access.
- **Replay Attacks**: Attackers can capture and replay serialized data to repeat actions without proper authorization.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Avoid using serialization when communicating with untrusted clients whenever possible.
- Implement integrity checks, such as digital signatures or message authentication codes (MAC), to ensure the integrity of serialized data.
- Use encryption to protect serialized data containing sensitive information during transmission.

For example, if an application must serialize objects for communication with a client, the serialized data should be signed with a private key to ensure it has not been tampered with. Additionally, encrypting the serialized data helps protect it from being read or manipulated by attackers during transit.

By enforcing these controls, organizations can protect against deserialization attacks and ensure the integrity and security of their data.
