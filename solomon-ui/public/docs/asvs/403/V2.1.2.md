*V2.1 Password Security*

# Maximum Password Length

> Verify that passwords of at least 64 characters are permitted, and that passwords of more than 128 characters are denied.

## Objective
The primary goal of this requirement is to support the creation of strong passwords by allowing sufficiently long passwords while preventing excessively long passwords that could cause performance issues or security vulnerabilities.

## Rationale
Allowing passwords up to 64 characters encourages users to create more complex and secure passwords. Setting an upper limit of 128 characters prevents potential performance problems and security issues, such as buffer overflows, which can occur with extremely long inputs.

## What You Should Do
1. **Set Maximum Length**: Ensure your application allows passwords up to 64 characters and restricts those exceeding 128 characters.
2. **Handle Input Safely**: Properly handle and validate input to avoid buffer overflows and ensure performance.

## Summary
By enforcing a maximum password length of 64 characters and denying passwords longer than 128 characters, you can enhance the security of your application's password policies. This approach ensures strong, manageable passwords while preventing potential performance and security issues.
