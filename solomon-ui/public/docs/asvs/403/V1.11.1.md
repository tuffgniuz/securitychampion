# Definition and Documentation of Application Components

> Verify the definition and documentation of all application components in terms of the business or security functions they provide.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that every application component is clearly defined and documented, specifying the business or security functions they perform. This clarity helps in understanding the purpose and functionality of each component, facilitating better management, maintenance, and security analysis.

## Rationale
Defining and documenting application components helps to:
- **Improve Maintainability**: Clear documentation makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the system.
- **Enhance Security**: Knowing the specific functions of each component helps in identifying potential security vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate security measures.
- **Facilitate Compliance**: Proper documentation supports compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.
- **Support Incident Response**: Detailed knowledge of component functions aids in diagnosing and responding to security incidents effectively.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Create comprehensive documentation that includes descriptions of each application component, the business functions they perform, and the security controls in place.
- Use architectural diagrams to visually represent the relationships and interactions between components.
- Ensure that documentation is regularly updated to reflect changes in the application architecture and component functionality.
- Implement a review process to verify the accuracy and completeness of the documentation.

For example, in an e-commerce application, the components might be documented as follows:
- **User Authentication Service**: Handles user login, registration, and password management. Security measures include multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password hashing.
- **Product Catalog Service**: Manages the inventory of products available for sale. Includes role-based access controls to restrict who can add or modify products.
- **Order Processing Service**: Manages the creation, payment, and fulfillment of customer orders. Implements encryption for payment data and audit logging for order transactions.

By defining and documenting all application components and their functions, organizations can ensure that each part of the application is properly understood, managed, and secured.
