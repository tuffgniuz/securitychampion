# Source Code Control System

> Verify that a source code control system is in use, with procedures to ensure that check-ins are accompanied by issues or change tickets. The source code control system should have access control and identifiable users to allow traceability of any changes.

## Objective
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that a robust source code control system is implemented. This system should enforce processes that require changes to be documented and traceable, ensuring accountability and integrity of the codebase.

## Rationale
Implementing a source code control system helps to:
- **Ensure Traceability**: Identifiable users and documented changes allow for tracking modifications and understanding their context.
- **Enhance Accountability**: Requiring issues or change tickets for check-ins ensures that changes are reviewed and authorized.
- **Maintain Code Integrity**: Controlled access and documented changes reduce the risk of unauthorized or malicious modifications.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: A structured source code control system improves coordination and collaboration among team members.
- **Improve Security Posture**: Regular auditing and traceability help in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities introduced through code changes.

## Practical Example
To meet this requirement, an organization might:
- Use a version control system (VCS) like Git, Mercurial, or Subversion.
- Implement policies that require each code check-in to be associated with an issue or change ticket from a project management tool like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues.
- Configure the VCS to require user authentication, ensuring that all changes are attributable to specific users.
- Set up role-based access controls to limit who can make changes to critical parts of the codebase.
- Regularly review and audit the commit history to ensure compliance with the established procedures.

For example, a development team using Git might integrate it with Jira, such that every commit message must reference a Jira ticket. The team could also enforce branch protection rules, requiring code reviews and approvals before merging changes into the main branch.
