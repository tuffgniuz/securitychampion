## Summary

</div>

Solomon is a self-hosted web application designed to simplify the collection and understanding of ASVS security requirements.

### What is Solomon?
Solomon is a comprehensive tool designed to demystify and integrate the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) within the software development lifecycle. As a self-hosted and open-source web application, Solomon empowers developers to seamlessly create issues and map security requirements directly from the ASVS, facilitating a deeper understanding and easier application of these standards in their projects. The core idea is to transform the often daunting perception of security compliance into an approachable and manageable aspect of everyday coding activities.

By breaking down the ASVS into digestible, actionable items, Solomon sets a lower barrier for entry, making security standards less intimidating and more accessible to developers. This not only improves security awareness but also ensures that essential security practices are integrated naturally and effectively within the development process. Just as Neorg revolves around a single base file format to unlock its full potential, Solomon centralizes security requirements gathering and understanding, providing a unified platform where developers can interact with and apply security criteria without needing to navigate complex external documents or guidelines.

In essence, Solomon acts as a bridge between the theoretical and practical aspects of software security. It simplifies the task of adhering to security standards by providing a user-friendly interface where developers can directly relate project tasks with specific ASVS requirements. This approach not only enhances security compliance but also fosters a culture of proactive security mindfulness, enabling teams to build safer, more reliable software from the ground up.
