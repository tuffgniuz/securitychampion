# Ensure Lookup Secrets Have Sufficient Entropy

---

## Simplified Explanation

Lookup secrets must have sufficient randomness (112 bits of entropy) or, if less, be combined with a unique and random 32-bit salt and hashed.

## Objective

To secure lookup secrets against brute force and guessing attacks by ensuring they have high entropy or are adequately protected.

## Rationale

Lookup secrets, like password reset tokens or authentication codes, need to be unpredictable to prevent attackers from guessing them. Ensuring these secrets have at least 112 bits of entropy makes them highly resistant to brute force attacks. If the entropy is less, adding a unique and random 32-bit salt and hashing the secret can significantly increase its security.

## Implementation Tips

- Generate lookup secrets with a minimum of 112 bits of entropy to ensure they are sufficiently random and secure.
- If generating high-entropy secrets is not feasible, enhance security by adding a unique and random 32-bit salt to the secret before hashing it.
- Use strong, cryptographic hashing functions to protect the secrets and their integrity.

By following these guidelines, the strength and security of lookup secrets can be significantly enhanced, protecting against unauthorized access and attacks.
