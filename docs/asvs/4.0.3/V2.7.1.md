# Secure Out-of-Band Authenticators

---

## Simplified Explanation

Avoid using clear text out-of-band authenticators like SMS or PSTN for verification, and prioritize more secure methods such as push notifications.

## Objective

To strengthen the security of multi-factor authentication (MFA) by favoring more secure communication channels for transmitting authentication data.

## Rationale

Clear text out-of-band authenticators, such as SMS or PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), are considered 'restricted' by NIST due to their susceptibility to interception and other security vulnerabilities. These methods can be compromised by attackers through techniques like SIM swapping or network interception. Offering more secure alternatives, like push notifications through encrypted channels, as the primary method for out-of-band authentication enhances the security of the MFA process.

## Implementation Tips

- Evaluate the security of different out-of-band authentication methods to determine their suitability and risk level.
- Prioritize the use of secure channels, like encrypted push notifications, which provide better protection against interception and unauthorized access.
- Implement fallback mechanisms that maintain security standards, avoiding reliance on insecure clear text methods unless absolutely necessary and with additional safeguards.
- Educate users on the security features and benefits of the preferred authentication methods to encourage their acceptance and use.

By following these guidelines, organizations can ensure that their out-of-band authentication mechanisms contribute effectively to the overall security of their multi-factor authentication systems.
