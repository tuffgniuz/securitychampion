# Resist Offline Attacks for Lookup Secrets

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure lookup secrets, such as tokens or codes used for authentication or password recovery, are designed to resist offline attacks and cannot be guessed or predicted.

## Objective

To protect lookup secrets from being compromised through offline methods like brute-force attacks or predictability analysis.

## Rationale

Lookup secrets are critical for processes like authentication verification and password recovery. These secrets need to be resistant to offline attacks, meaning they should be designed in a way that makes them difficult to predict or brute-force without direct interaction with the authentication system. This involves ensuring that the secrets are sufficiently random, unique, and have a limited lifespan to prevent attackers from successfully guessing or precalculating them.

## Implementation Tips

- Use strong, cryptographic methods to generate lookup secrets with high entropy, making them hard to guess or predict.
- Limit the validity period of lookup secrets to minimize the window during which they can be used, reducing the risk of offline attacks.
- Implement mechanisms to detect and block multiple attempts to use invalid or expired secrets, enhancing the overall security of the lookup secret mechanism.

By securing lookup secrets against offline attacks, organizations can strengthen the security of their authentication and recovery processes, protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of their systems.
