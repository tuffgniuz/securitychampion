# No Default Credentials for Service Authentication

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that service accounts use secure, unique credentials instead of default ones like 'root/root' or 'admin/admin' commonly set during initial installation.

## Objective

To prevent unauthorized access by eliminating predictable default credentials in service authentication, enhancing system security.

## Rationale

Using default credentials for service accounts can pose a significant security risk, as they are often well-known and can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. Ensuring that services are configured with unique, secure passwords from the start mitigates this risk and secures the service against unauthorized use.

## Implementation Tips

- Always change default credentials during the initial setup of services or software installations.
- Implement policies and procedures to ensure that all default passwords are replaced with strong, unique passwords before moving services to production.
- Use password management tools to generate and manage strong, unique passwords for each service account, avoiding manual selection of predictable passwords.

Adopting these practices helps in securing service accounts against unauthorized access and potential security breaches by ensuring that they are not left with default, easily guessable credentials.
