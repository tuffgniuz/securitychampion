# No Composition Rules for Passwords

---

## Simplified Explanation

Do not enforce rules on password composition such as requiring uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.

## Objective

To allow for more user-friendly and flexible password creation while maintaining security.

## Rationale

Mandatory composition rules often lead to predictable password patterns and user frustration. Research shows that users tend to create passwords that meet the bare minimum requirements, leading to common patterns that can be easily guessed by attackers. Removing strict composition rules encourages users to create more varied and complex passwords, potentially increasing security. By focusing on length and uniqueness rather than specific character types, users can create more secure and memorable passwords, reducing the reliance on common patterns and improving overall security.

## Implementation Tips

Instead of enforcing traditional composition rules, focus on educating users about creating strong, unique passwords and utilizing password managers. Ensure that your password policy checks for length and known weak passwords without mandating specific character types. Hereâ€™s how you might approach this in a policy function:

```plaintext
function isPasswordComplexEnough(password: string): boolean {
  const minLength = 12;
  return password.length >= minLength && !isCommonPassword(password);
}
```

This pseudocode checks that the password is not a common password and meets a minimum length requirement, promoting the creation of secure and user-friendly passwords.
