# Verify Password Change with Current Password

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that users must enter their current password when changing to a new one to confirm their identity.

## Objective

To confirm the identity of the user requesting a password change, preventing unauthorized modifications.

## Rationale

Requiring the current password during the password change process adds an additional layer of security by verifying the identity of the individual requesting the change. This practice helps to prevent attackers from easily changing a user's password if they have temporary access to a user's session or device. It acts as a critical check to ensure that the requestor is the legitimate account owner, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized account takeover and potential data breaches.

## Implementation Tips

Implement the password change feature to require users to authenticate with their current password before setting a new one. Hereâ€™s how you can integrate this into the password change process:

```plaintext
function validatePasswordChange(currentPassword: string, newPassword: string, userContext: UserContext): boolean {
  if (verifyCurrentPassword(userContext.userId, currentPassword)) {
    if (isPasswordPolicyCompliant(newPassword)) {
      updateUserPassword(userContext.userId, newPassword);
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

In this function, `verifyCurrentPassword` checks if the provided current password is correct, `isPasswordPolicyCompliant` ensures the new password meets the security standards, and `updateUserPassword` changes the password in the system. This method helps in maintaining secure management of user credentials.
