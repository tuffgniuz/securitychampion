# Avoid Knowledge-based Authentication for Password Recovery

---

## Simplified Explanation

Do not use knowledge-based authentication, such as "secret questions," for password recovery or verification processes.

## Objective

To prevent security risks associated with easily guessable or researchable answers to secret questions.

## Rationale

Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), often implemented as "secret questions," involves verifying a user's identity through answers to personalized questions. This method is vulnerable because answers can often be guessed, researched, or phished, especially if the questions are common and the answers are publicly available or easily deducible. Moving away from KBA enhances security by reducing reliance on potentially weak and exploitable verification methods.

## Implementation Tips

- Replace knowledge-based authentication with more secure methods, like sending a temporary code to a verified email address or phone number.
- Utilize multi-factor authentication processes that require something the user has (like a token or mobile phone) in addition to something they know (their password).
- Ensure that any recovery or verification codes are used within a short time frame and are invalidated after use.

By avoiding knowledge-based authentication for password recovery, organizations can strengthen the security of the recovery process and better protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
