# Provide Password Strength Meter

---

## Simplified Explanation

Implement a password strength meter to help users understand the security level of their chosen password.

## Objective

To aid users in creating strong passwords by providing real-time feedback on the strength of their password.

## Rationale

A password strength meter is an interactive tool that assesses the complexity of a password and provides users with visual feedback on its security level. This real-time feedback helps users understand how their choices affect the strength of their password, encouraging them to improve it before finalizing. By guiding users towards stronger passwords, the strength meter contributes to the overall security of the system, reducing the risk of successful brute-force attacks and enhancing user awareness of good password practices.

## Implementation Tips

Integrate a password strength meter into the user interface where passwords are created or changed. The meter should evaluate various aspects of password strength, such as length, diversity of characters, and common password patterns. Here's a basic example of how to calculate password strength:

```plaintext
function getPasswordStrength(password: string): string {
  const strengthLevels = ['Weak', 'Moderate', 'Strong', 'Very Strong'];
  let score = 0;

  if (password.length >= 8) score++;
  if (/[A-Z]/.test(password)) score++;
  if (/[0-9]/.test(password)) score++;
  if (/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password)) score++;

  return strengthLevels[score];
}
```

This function assigns a score based on the presence of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, as well as the password's length, categorizing the password into different strength levels.
