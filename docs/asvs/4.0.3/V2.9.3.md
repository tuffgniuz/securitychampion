# Use of Approved Cryptographic Algorithms

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that only approved cryptographic algorithms are used for generating, seeding, and verifying cryptographic operations.

## Objective

To maintain the security and integrity of cryptographic operations by using algorithms that are recognized as secure and reliable.

## Rationale

Using approved cryptographic algorithms is essential to ensure the security of cryptographic operations. These algorithms have been rigorously tested and verified to be secure against known attack methods. The use of unapproved or weak algorithms can lead to vulnerabilities, making cryptographic operations susceptible to attacks such as decryption and data manipulation.

## Implementation Tips

- Adhere to industry standards and guidelines, such as those from NIST, to select cryptographic algorithms that are proven to be secure.
- Regularly review and update the cryptographic algorithms used, to replace deprecated algorithms with current secure options.

Approved cryptographic algorithms include:
- **Symmetric key algorithms**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
- **Asymmetric key algorithms**: RSA with key sizes of at least 2048 bits, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) with key sizes of at least 256 bits.
- **Hashing algorithms**: SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
- **Key derivation functions**: PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2.

- Ensure that the generation, seeding, and verification processes in cryptographic operations use these approved algorithms to maintain the security of data and communications.

By following these practices and using approved cryptographic algorithms, organizations can safeguard their cryptographic processes against potential threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.
