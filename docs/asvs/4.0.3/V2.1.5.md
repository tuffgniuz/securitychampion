# Ensure Users Can Change Their Password

---

## Simplified Explanation

Users must have the ability to change their password whenever necessary.

## Objective

To empower users with the control to update their passwords, enhancing personal security and responding to potential security threats.

## Rationale

The ability for users to change their password is a fundamental aspect of secure account management. It allows users to respond to potential security breaches by updating their credentials promptly, thereby limiting unauthorized access. Regular password changes, especially following incidents or suspicions of compromise, are crucial in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user accounts. This practice helps in mitigating the risks associated with stolen or leaked passwords and is a key component of proactive security hygiene.

## Implementation Tips

Implement a straightforward and secure process for users to change their password. The system should:

1. Verify the userâ€™s identity before allowing the password change.
2. Ensure the new password complies with the organization's password policy.
3. Invalidate the old password immediately after the change.

Example of a password change function:

```plaintext
function changePassword(userId: string, oldPassword: string, newPassword: string): boolean {
  if (authenticateUser(userId, oldPassword)) {
    if (isPasswordPolicyCompliant(newPassword)) {
      updateUserPassword(userId, newPassword);
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

This function checks that the user's current password is correct, the new password meets the policy standards, and then updates the password, ensuring a secure password change mechanism.
