# No Periodic Password Rotation Requirement

---

## Simplified Explanation

Do not require users to change their passwords at regular intervals.

## Objective

To avoid the security pitfalls associated with forced periodic password changes and to promote sustained strong password practices.

## Rationale

Mandatory periodic password changes have been shown to lead to weaker security practices, such as the creation of less secure passwords and the reuse of similar passwords across different systems. Users often make minor modifications to existing passwords to meet rotation policies, which can be predictable and easily exploited by attackers. Eliminating the requirement for periodic password changes reduces the risk of these insecure practices, encouraging users to maintain strong, unique passwords for longer periods, and to change passwords only in response to actual or suspected security incidents.

## Implementation Tips

Educate users on creating strong, memorable passwords and encourage them to change these only if there's evidence of a compromise. Monitor accounts for unusual activity to detect potential breaches:
