# Limit Use of Weak Authenticators

---

## Simplified Explanation

Restrict the use of weak authenticators like SMS or email for primary authentication, using them instead for secondary verification or additional transaction approval.

## Objective

To prevent reliance on inherently insecure authentication methods, enhancing overall security posture.

## Rationale

Weak authenticators, such as SMS and email, are susceptible to various attacks, including interception, phishing, and social engineering. While they can provide a layer of security, relying on them as the sole authentication method is risky. Prioritizing stronger, more secure authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures a higher level of account security. The guideline encourages using weak authenticators only as part of a multi-layered security approach, ensuring that users are better protected against unauthorized access.

## Implementation Tips

- Offer stronger authentication methods (e.g., hardware tokens, biometric, mobile push notifications) before weaker ones.
- Inform users about the risks associated with weak authentication methods.
- Implement risk-based authentication that adapts the required level of authentication based on the user's behavior and context.
