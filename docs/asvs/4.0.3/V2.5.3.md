# Transmit Passwords Securely During Recovery

---

## Simplified Explanation

Ensure that passwords or password reset links are transmitted securely during the account recovery process.

## Objective

To protect the security of password recovery mechanisms and prevent interception of sensitive information.

## Rationale

During the password recovery process, the transmission of reset links, temporary passwords, or other sensitive information must be secured to prevent eavesdropping and interception by malicious actors. Secure transmission methods, such as encrypted email or HTTPS for web-based recovery, are essential to safeguard this information. This ensures that only the intended user can access the means to reset their password, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the account recovery process.

By implementing secure transmission practices, organizations can protect the password recovery process from being exploited by attackers and ensure that account recovery mechanisms are robust and secure.
